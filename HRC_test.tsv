jacqueline charles jcharles@miamiherald.corn call it the $100 million club. that's the amount each donor nation will have to ante up for a say in haiti's early recovery under a plan haitian president rene preval plans to present at an international donors conference in new york at month's end. while haitian and foreign disaster experts were tallying the cost to rebuild after the jan. 12, 7.0-magnitude earthquake -- $11.5 billion -- preval and his advisors have been quietly negotiating the blueprint of the development plan that will shape haiti's reconstruction over the next decade. \"it moves it in the right direction,\" mark schneider, senior vice president of the washington d.c.-based international crisis group, said of the plan, which he has seen. \"i've said, the first phase of reconstruction is a decade. the real test is a generation and hopefully with partnerships both inside and outside of haiti, it will continue for that time period.\" the plan includes creation of an interim haitian recovery commission that will -- for the first time -- seek to guide how and where aid is spent by giving both haitians and foreigners a vote in reconstruction priorities and projects over the next 18 months. haiti's president will retain veto power and there's a starring role for former u.s. president bill clinton if he wants it. the blueprint is certain to come under plenty of scrutiny in haiti, a country plagued and in-fighting among donors. over the years, billions of dollars in aid -- often delivered after hurricanes or political coups -- has failed to produce any signs of lasting progress in a country that remains the poorest in the western hemisphere. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05768926 date: 08/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05768926 date: 08/31/2015 clinton, who is to visit haiti monday along with former president george w. bush, will be asked to help lead haiti's reconstruction planning over the short-term as co-chair -- along with the haitian prime minister - - of the commission, several sources confirmed to the miami herald. clinton, who is already in charge of the international relief effort for the united nations, has not said whether he'll accept the job as haiti's reconstruction czar but he has championed the strategy, saying the goal is to provide to haitians the success that has long eluded them.he and bush are visiting haiti, where more than 200,000 people were killed in the quake, in their roles as co-chairs of the clinton bush haiti fund. the private u.s. fundraising effort, initiated by president obama, has raised more than $36 million. the commission's goal will be to plan and coordinate reconstruction priorities and projects over the next 18 months with recommendations from a 20-member board made up of haitians and foreign donors. eventually, the commission would morph into the haiti development authority (hda), a central planning agency tasked with approving all reconstruction projects in haiti regardless of which country or aid agency is funding it. the authority's executive director, like that of the commission, likely would be a well-respected haitian. \"haitians must have the chance to lead the rebuilding of haiti,\" said u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton's chief of staff  , a key person in talks. \"development authorities have helped other countries that have large donor communities to accomplish their visions -- we want no less for haiti and its citizens.\" the original plan, first reported by the herald last month, was modeled on the successful reconstruction authority created in indonesia after the 2004 tsunami and presented by  to preval and top haitian officials last month. other countries and multilateral institutions also presented plans to the haitian government. the u.s. plan has since undergone several revisions at preyal's urging. among them: offering a voting seat on the commission's board to each donor pledging $100 million or more over the next two years and donors who provide $200 million in debt cancellation. as a result, venezuela is among the likely donors to help review and approve projects. initially 16 members, the board was expanded to give a say-so to haiti's private sector and labor unions and the 15-nation sub-regional caribbean community (carciom). the plan also establishes a multi-donor trust fund, administered by the world bank, to possibly pool donors' dollars for reconstruction projects. for decades, haiti has been plagued by a lack of planning and coordination among donor nations and aid groups as they battled among each other in the poverty-stricken country. using the indonesian model employed in indonesia after the asian tsunami, plan supporters say the reconstruction commission offers haiti the best chance to lead its own redevelopment and to change the way donors do business, ending an era where aid groups spend budgets larger than haitian ministries without any accountability to the haitian people. but that can only be achieved in haiti, say supporters, if donors and their projects are coordinated, and in line with haiti's vision and post-disaster reconstruction needs, which will be presented at the march 31 new york conference and remains a work in progress while the government seeks input from various haitian groups, including the diaspora. also haiti's parliament must vote on the creation of the interim haitian recovery commission. still, the idea of putting haiti's reconstruction into the hands of one central authority -- or having some donors channel their money into a trust fund -- is not without detractors. some argue that the authority could render government ministries obsolete because projects would now bypass them, while others point out that unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05768926 date: 08/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05768926 date: 08/31/2015 a similar world bank fund in the sudan has been troubled by rules leaving schools and healthcare facilities undone as hundreds of millions of dollars remain unspent. meanwhile, haitian government officials worry that donors may not want to change the way they do business with haiti, rendering the reconstruction a failure before it gets started. \"the creation of the [trust fund] or the [haiti development authority] are improvements to changing the paradigm if and only if everybody plays the game -- putting most of their money in the fund -- and access to the funds is more flexible than the usual process of disbursing from the international donors,\" haitian prime minister jean-max bellerive told the herald. in the past, donors have pledged hundreds of millions of dollars to assist haiti but have fallen short in disbursing those dollars -- or at times spent the money on projects without consulting the haitian government about whether the projects were needed. last week, as representatives of the haitian government and others met to prepare for the new york conference, bellerive warned that \"new york could be a failure if we don't reach an agreement on the structure for the coordination and the organization of the trust fund. ..(and) don't manage to establish together the priorities for immediate investments,\" to begin reconstructing

dismantling general motors and rewriting the rules of american capitalism. but that, in short, is the job description for brian deese, a not-quite graduate of yale law school who had never set foot in an automotive assembly plant until he took on his nearly unseen role in remaking the american automotive industry. nor, for that matter, had he given much thought to what ailed an industry that had been in decline ever since he was born. a bit laconic and looking every bit the just-out-of-graduate-school student adjusting to life in the west wing  \"he's got this beard that appears and disappears,\" says steven rattner, one of the leaders of president obama's automotive task force  mr. deese was thrown into the auto industry's maelstrom as soon the election-night parties ended. \"there was a time between nov. 4 and mid-february when i was the only full-time member of the auto task force,\" mr. deese, a special assistant to the president for economic policy, acknowledged recently as he hurried between his desk at the white house and the treasury building next door. \"it was a little scary.\" but now, according to those who joined him in the middle of his crash course about the automakers' downward spiral, he has emerged as one of the most influential voices in what may become president obama's biggest experiment yet in federal economic intervention. while far more prominent members of the administration are making the big decisions about detroit, it is mr. deese who is often narrowing their options. a month ago, when the administration was divided over whether to support fiat's bid to take over much of chrysler, it was mr. deese who spoke out strongly against simply letting the company go into liquidation, according to several people who were present for the debate. \"brian grasps both the economics and the politics about as quickly as i've seen anyone do this,\" said lawrence h. summers, the head of the national economic council who is not known for being patient whenever he believes an analysis is sub-par  or disagrees with his own. \"and there he was in the roosevelt room, speaking up vigorously to make the point that the costs we were going to incur giving fiat a chance were no greater than some of the hidden costs of liquidation.\" mr. deese was not the only one favoring the fiat deal, but his lengthy memorandum on how liquidation would increase medicaid costs, unemployment insurance and municipal bankruptcies ended the debate. the administration supported q1 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no.

judge handling the high-speed bankruptcy proceeding approves the sale of chrysler's best assets to the italian carmaker. mr. deese's role is unusual for someone who is neither a formally trained economist nor a business school graduate, and who never spent much time flipping through the endless studies about the future of the american and japanese auto industries. he lives a dual life these days. he starts the day at a desk wedged just outside of mr. summers's office, where he can hear what young members of the economic team have come to know as \"the summers bellow.\" from there, he can make it quickly to the press office to help devise explanations for whytaxpayers are spending more than $50 billion on what polls show is a very unpopular bailout of the auto industry. several times a day he speed-walks to treasury, taking a shortcut through the tunnel under the colonnade, near the kitchens. the other day he talked about how sharply perceptions of the industry's future changed after mr. obama's election. \"at the first meeting with rick wagoner,\" he said, referring to g.m.'s recently deposed chief executive, \"they were in a very different place. he said publicly that bankruptcy was not a viable option. it's been a long process getting everyone to look at the options differently.\" in fact, from before inauguration day, few in mr. obama's circle saw any other choice. every time mr. deese ran the numbers on g.m. and chrysler, he came back with the now-obvious conclusion that neither was a viable business, and that their plans to revive themselves did not address the erosion of their revenues. but it took the support of mr. rattner and ron bloom, senior advisers to the task force charged with restructuring the automobile industry, to help turn mr. deese's positions into policy. \"the president's instruction to us was that we had to come up with a solution that would work on a commercial basis, that didn't involve indefinite federal financing,\" mr. deese said. \"but we didn't want liquidation, which would have even worse effects. so the question was how do you design a very substantial restructuring, and do it fast.\" mr. deese's route to the auto table at the white house was anything but a straight line. he is the son of a political science professor at boston college (his father) and an engineer who works in renewable energy (his mother). he grew up in the boston suburb of belmont and attended middlebury college in vermont. he went to washington to work on aid issues and was quickly hired by nancy birdsall, a widely respected authority on the effectiveness of international aid and the founder of the center for global development. but he wanted to learn domestic issues as well, and soon ended up working as an assistant for gene sperling, who 17 years ago in the clinton white house played a similar role as economic policy prodigy. eventually, mr. deese headed to yale for his law degree. but his e-mail box was constantly filled with messages from friends in washington who were signing up to work for the obama or hillary rodham clinton campaigns. mr. deese chose senator clinton's. \"he was pretty quickly functioning as the top economic policy staffer through her campaign,\" mr. sperling said. \"he could blend the policy needs and the political needs pretty seamlessly.\" on the day that the clinton campaign ended, mr. deese left her concession speech and received a message on his blackberry from a friend in the obama campaign urging him to sign on immediately to mr. obama's team. he resumed his policy work there, and found himself stuck in chicago  unable to fly to washington with his dog  as the economic crisis deepened. finally, one night, he decided to get into his car with his dog and just started driving back to washington. tired, he pulled over to catch some sleep in the car. 97 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05761441 date: 06/30/2015 unclassified u.s.

(the united states commission on international religious freedom, a congressionally mandated body, has noted a logical flaw: defamation means harming the reputation of a living person or entity: that implies that one can't defame an idea or a religious founder who is no longer, at least physically, alive on earth.) but critics of the oic campaign, who include atheists, christians and indeed some muslims, say the \"defamation\" idea is worse than hot air: far from protecting human rights, it emboldens countries that use blasphemy laws to criminalise dissent. what encourages these critics is that more countries seem to be coming around to their view. mexico, uruguay, argentina, zambia and south korea voted against the latest resolution. brazil criticised the text but abstained. deeper still inside the un's bureaucracy, another battle over religion ragesand the stakes could be even higher. an \"ad hoc committee\" is mulling ways to amend or extend the un convention on racial discrimination. certain states want language that would fuse the categories of race and faith; some want a new convention, or a protocol to the existing one. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05768055 date: 08/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05768055 date: 08/31/2015 for secularists (in the broad sense of people, including believers, who oppose the idea of faith having privileged access to power), all this is alarming. non-binding resolutions against defamation are bad enough; a un treaty on race-plus-religion would have legal force, at least for its signatories, and give heart to theocrats. at the hrc's latest discussion of this effort in march, the algerian who oversees the project was keen to plough ahead. but countries like switzerland, japan, mexico, argentina and france retorted that it would be better to enforce the existing un norms than dream up new ones. efforts to widen the racism accord will resume, with a new chairman, late this yearbut critics are relieved to have stalled it. still, would-be theocrats may now focus harder on adding to the racism charter, because they face a real risk of being defeated over defamation, in the view of roy brown, geneva spokesman for the international humanist and ethical union. meanwhile a christian-inspired ngo, the european centre for law and justice, has been denouncing the abuse of blasphemy laws in many oic member states. how fair is their point? it is an easy case to make, for example, over pakistan. some 41 complaints of blasphemy were registered by police in pakistan last year, says that country's independent human rights commission. in theory, blasphemy is punishable by deatha penalty that has been handed down but never carried out. worst-hit by the law are minorities like christians and ahmadis, a group whose claim to be muslim is rejected by the pakistani state. although abuse of the law is less rife now than in the 1980s, when an islamist general tightened up the rules, the law is still invoked in disputes (over property, say) that have nothing to do with faith. \"the most vulnerable people, that is religious minorities, continue to be charged with blasphemy,\" said ali dayan hasan, a researcher at human rights watch, a campaign group. \"but are people convicted? no. rarely. it is used as an instrument of political and social coercion.\" when convictions occur, they lead to long jail terms; and pre-trial detention can last for years. pakistan's parliament is revising the constitution but it has left intact the religious bits, despite a vow by the ruling party to review the blasphemy laws. (indonesia too has stepped back from a move to liberalise its blasphemy regime.) on pakistani streets, the law has dire effects. in january 2009, in a village in punjab province, five ahmadis, a labourer and four children, were charged with blasphemy. they had supposedly written \"prophet muhammad\" on the wall of a mosque toilet. the children were behind bars for nearly six months till the charge was quashed. and last september a young pakistani christian was accused of throwing part of the koran down a drain. it seems that his real crime, however, was affection for a muslim woman. a mob torched a church, and many christians had to flee. he was taken to jail, where he died a few days later. his family alleged torture; the authorities claimed suicide. there was mayhem at the funeral and the country's christians (see picture) were appalled. in some places, it is not the \"defamation\" of faith that threatens rights but measures that supposedly defend it. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05768055 date: 08/31/2015  "

(berlusconi is suing la repu.bblica, the large independent newspaper in rome that has been most aggressive in digging into his affairs of all kind.) it would seem proper and decent for the president to call berlusconi to express his concern about his health and wish him a speedy recovery, if he hasn't done so already. there are many reasons for oba.ma to do this, not least to condemn violence against a democratically elected head of state. it would be awkward for the u.s. president not to call a western head of state of a nato country who has been physically harmed. berlusconi, for his part, would certainly make such a call public. it would therefore also be awkward if a call were used only as an element in his sympathy campaign against the court proceedings. if so, there is a larger message that should be communicated, perhaps by the president in his conversation, but most importantly through a statement from the state department, also conveyed by the u.s. ambassador in italy. the usg condemns any and all violence as an assault on democracy. by the same measure, this incident involving an apparently deranged individual should not be exploited to raise unclassified

berlusconi below: http://www.independentocb.uk/newszworldieuruei edusconi-cut-deal- with-mafia-court-told-1834647.html berlusconi 'cut deal with mafia', court told former hitman claims italian pm gave 'benefits' to the mob for political support by michael day in milan saturday, 5 december 2009 the italian prime minister, silvio berlusconi, made a deal with the sicilian mafia in the early 1990s that put the country \"in the hands\" of the mob, a court in turin was told yesterday. g-aspare spatuzza, a jailed mafia hitman turned witness, told a packed and heavily guarded bunker courtroom that his cosa nostra godfather boss had cut a deal with mr berlusconi in 1993 that provided unspecified \"benefits\" to the mafia in exchange for political support. the media tycoon entered. politics a few months later and won his first term as prime minister in 1994. spatuzza said his boss, giuseppe graviano, who was jailed over mafia bomb attacks in rome, milan and florence, had told him that the mob had \"got everything\" with the help of mr berlusconi, adding that graviano called mr berlusconi \"the man from channel 5\", in reference to his tv network. the damaging claims came at the appeal hearing of marcell dell'utri, a key berlusconi associate and senator, who is challenging his nine-year jail sentence for links with the mafia. spatuzza, in prison for several murders, testified: \"graviano told me the name of berlusconi and said that thanks to him and the man from our home town [an apparent reference to dell' utri] we have the country in our hands.\"  mr berlusconi has denounced the claims of spatuzza as \"vile\", and \"unfounded and defamatory\", denying ever having links with the mafia. the prime minister's spokesman said the testimony yesterday was the mafia's \"completely logical\" revenge against the prime minister for his \"determined\" fight against organised crime. dell'utri told the court that neither he nor mr berlusconi had mafia connections. \"it's in the interest of the mafia to force the collapse of the berlusconi government because this government has done the most in the fight against organised crime,\" he said. mr berlusconi, who recently lost his legal immunity to prosecution, was said to have been furious this week, after the parliamentary speaker, gianfranco fini, the man who is supposed to be his closest ally, had said that the spatuzza evidence was \"an atomic bomb\". mr fini was recorded by an unobserved microphone while talking privately at an official dinner. rumours of the conservative prime minister's links with the mob have persisted since investigators learnt that a cosa nostra hitman, vittorio mangano, worked as mr berlusconi's \"stable-master\" at the media mogul's villa in arcore outside milan in the 1970s. much speculation has also centred on the origins of mr berlusconi's vast wealth. last week, the prime minister's broadcast group, mediaset, and his holding company, fininvest, announced it intended to sue the left-wing newspaper la repubblica over an article that said mediaset was \"20 per cent owned by the mafia\". la stampa newspaper noted that the \"dread combination of mafia allegations and separation from his wife are now his principal torments\". mr berlusconi's estranged wife, veronica lario, is said to be seeking a f3m-a- month divorce settlement, and a messy courtroom battle looms. mr berlusconi also faces a retrial on the charge that he bribed the british lawyer david mills to lie in court. time friday, dec. 04, 2009 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439

the world has spent the past six months wondering how  and with whom -- silvio berlusconi spends his saturday nights. but the combative, scandal-plagued prime minister of italy would prefer to talk about his mornings instead. \"do you know how i've been forced to spend my saturday mornings since i entered politics?\" berlusconi once declared to business leaders in rome. \"with my lawyers.\" italy's self-proclaimed defendant in chief makes a. point of lamenting all those weekends spoiled by stacks of court dossiers. as further proof that he is the victim of politically motivated magistrates, whom he called during the same speech \"the spreading cancer of our democracy.\" lsee berlusconi's worst vaffes.). to combat such perceived persecution, berlusconi has tested the bounds of decorous democratic conduct, including his allies' pushing a bill through parliament last year that gave him and other top italian officeholders immunity from prosecution. but since the constitutional court overturned that law in october, several criminal investigations into berlusconi's business dealings have been reopened, with other new charges rumored to be looming. the potentially most damaging trial is set to resume friday, dec. 4, in milan, with the 73-year-old billionaire being accused of paying british attorney david mills $600,000 in 1997 to withhold incriminating evidence about his broadcasting empire mediaset. mills is appealing a conviction in the same case; both men have denied any wrongdoing. so, alas, berlusconi is back to spending his downtime with a well-paid cadre of more than a dozen avvocati, who have been successful so far in keeping their biggest client clear of criminal convictions. not that the lawyers have ever really gone away. since the media baron first ran for office 15 years ago, his legal advisers have doubled as political consiglieri, key members of parliament and even important cabinet ministers. indeed, while some critics have spoken of berlusconi's reign as a kind of sultanate of showgirls or government by gaffe, others have described it as a republic of attorneys. (see what beriusconi's obama \"jok.es\" sqy about italy.) his longtime lawyer cesare previti served as italian defense minister during beriusconi's first term in 1994 before being convicted of corruption himself (and losing twice on appeal). during berlusconi's second term (2001-06), gaetano pecorella, a former leftist, served as president of parliament's justice commission, where he was instrumental in shepherding through new laws that helped shield berlusconi from investigating magistrates. giovanni sartori, a columbia university professor of constitutional law, says the role berlusconi's personal lawyers have played in his legislative agenda is yet another gargantuan conflict of interest to add to those related to his ownership of italy's main private television stations. but by now, sartori says, berlusconi's lawyers have perfected the art of exploiting italy's painfully slow justice system: many cases conclude without a final verdict because the statute of limitations has been reached. \"it is more a mania than a necessity,\" sartori says of berlusconi's near obsession in battling magistrates. \"he feels persecuted, and fighting the judges is what makes him happy.\" berlusconi's current point man is nicol ghedini, a somber-faced, lanky 49-year-old criminal-defense attorney from the northern city of padua, who has served in both the italian senate and the lower house of parliament. ghedini has continued to mount a grinding defense in the criminal cases, arguing in the mills case that berlusconi cannot be present in the milan courtroom for the next several months because of time conflicts with his duties as prime minister. ghedini has also spearheaded an increasingly aggressive legal strategy that has included several libel suits against opposition newspapers. he declared in september that if necessary, berlusconi would testify in a suit against a journalist who referred to rumors that the prime minister is impotent. last week, berlusconi vowed to launch additional suits against newspapers that printed unsubstantiated reports that a close adviser of his was involved in a 1993 bombing campaign by the sicilian mafia. (read \"an offended berlusconi goes on the offensive.\") despite these many legal headaches, 'berlusconi is embroiled in one other particularly thorny case that even he can't blame on overzealous magistrates. veronica lario, berlusconi's wife of more than. 20 years, filed for divorce earlier this year, which sparked an avalanche of accusations that he frequented a prostitute from bari unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05766018 date: 08/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05766018 date: 08/31/2015 and an underage model from naples. the milan daily corriere della sera reported last week that lario has demanded 3.5 million euros ($5.2 million) in monthly payments, and berlusconi countered with an offer of 300,000 euros ($450,000). no matter how this and the other cases shake out, there is little hope that berlusconi can avoid a mountain of lawyers' fees and some grim saturdays that he'd rather devote to other business and pleasures.  find this article at:  hit): //www. t e cornitimeiwo rid/article/0,85 99.1945439.,:00. html unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05766018 date: 08/31/2015  "

[update: a senior military officer denied sunday that petraeus sent a paper to the white house. \"centcom did have a team brief the cjcs on concerns revolving around the palestinian issue, and centcom did propose a ucp change, but to cjcs, not to the wh,\" the officer said via email. \"gen petraeus was not certain what might have been conveyed to the wh (if anything) from that brief to cjcs.\" (ucp means \"unified combatant command,\" like centcom; cjcs refers to mullen; and wh is the white house.)] the mullen briefing and petraeus's request hit the white house like a bombshell. while petraeus's request that centcom be expanded to include the palestinians was denied (\"it was dead on arrival,\" a pentagon officer confirms), the obama administration decided it would redouble its efforts pressing israel once again on the settlements issue, sending mitchell on a visit to a number of arab capitals and dispatching mullen for a carefully arranged meeting with the chief of the israeli general staff, lt. general gabi ashkenazi. while the american press speculated that mullen's trip focused on iran, the jcs chairman actually carried a blunt, and tough; message on the israeli-palestinian conflict: that israel had to see its conflict with the palestinians \"in a larger, regional, context\" -- as having a direct impact on america's status in the region. certainly, it was thought, israel would get the message. israel didn't. when vice president joe biden was embarrassed by an israeli announcement that the netanyahu government was building 1,600 new homes in east jerusalem, the administration reacted. but no one was more outraged than biden who, according to the israeli daily yedioth ahronoth, engaged in a private, and angry, exchange with the israeli prime minister not surprisingly, what biden told netanyahu reflected the importance the administration attached to petraeus's mullen briefing: \"this is starting to get dangerous for us,\" biden reportedly told netanyahu. \"what you're doing here undermines the security of our troops who are fighting in iraq, afghanistan and pakistan. that endangers us and it endangers regional peace.\" yedioth ahronoth went on to report: \"the vice president told his israeli hosts that since many people in the muslim world perceived a connection between israel's actions and us policy, any decision about construction that undermines palestinian rights in east jerusalem could have an impact on the personal safety of american troops fighting against islamic terrorism.\" the message couldn't be plainer: israel's intransigence could cost american lives. there are important and powerful lobbies in america: the nra, the american medical association, the lawyers -- and the israeli lobby. but no lobby is as important, or as powerful, as the u.s. military. while commentators and pundits might reflect that joe biden's trip to israel has forever shifted america's relationship with its erstwhile ally in the region, the real break came in january, when david petraeus sent a briefing team to the pentagon with a stark warning: america's relationship with israel is important, but not as important as the lives of america's soldiers. maybe israel gets the message now. mark perry's newest book is talking to terrorists <http://www.amazon.com/talking-terrorists-america-engage- enemies/dp/0465011179> http://warincontext.org/2010/03/14/israel-is-putting-american-lives-at-risk/ my piece on the briefing of admiral mullen by centcom senior officers has occasioned a great deal of comment, as well as some skepticism: how accurate is the account? was it told to me by direct participants in the briefing? is there any basis for imagining that petraeus has any kind of hidden agenda, whether that is a desire to expand centcom  or even hostility towards israel. i won't name my sources, even though it's clear to people in the pentagon  and certainly to general petraeus  who they are. was i told of the briefing by the briefers themselves? i will only say that there were four people in the briefing unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05768064 date: 08/31/2015

conflict. i know two of the people involved in the briefing. whether or not they are my sources is something for the reader to determine. the account is not only accurate, it's a precis of what actually happened. there is a lot more to it. the white house, state department and pentagon have not denied the account, and for good reason: it's true. is there any basis for imagining that petraeus has any kind of hidden agenda in ordering the briefing? i have been reporting on the american military for thirty years. my work on the joint chiefs of staff, four stars <http://www.amazon.com/four-stars-forty-year-americas-civilian/dp/0395429234> , is the authoritative account on the subject. i have deeply rooted contacts in the military that go back thirty years. i have never met a senior military officer whom i do not admire. there is no greater insult than to believe that general petraeus or any other senior american military officer would use the lives of american soldiers as a lever to enhance their own political future. my sense is that general petraeus neither likes nor dislikes israel: but he loves his country and he wants to protect our soldiers. the current crisis in american relations with israel is not a litmus test of general petraeus's loyalty to israel, but of his, and our, concern for those americans in uniform in the middle east. it is, perhaps, a sign of the depth of \"the biden crisis\" that every controversy of this type seems to get translated into whether or not america and its leaders are committed to israel's security. this isn't about israel's security, it's about our security. http://maxblumenthal.com/2010/03/pastor-hagee-and-netanyahus-lovefest-on-eve-of-bidens-arrival-in-israel/ netanyahu and pastor hagee's lovefest on eve of biden's arrival in israel <http://maxblumenthal.com/2010/03/pastor- hagee-and-netanyahus-lovefest-on-eve-of-bidens-arrival-in-israel/> on 03.09.10, by max (videos recorded by rachel tabachnick <http://zeek.forward.com/authors/rachel-tabachnick>; more videos coming shortly.) vice president joe biden was greeted in jerusalem with the announcement <http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/articielalecim5ioi_ojt09rjmwpnroxncndrprq3gd9eb9n580> that the israeli interior ministry approved the construction of 1600 new homes in occupied east jerusalem contrary to u.s. wishes and complicating biden's mission <http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/mar/07/joe-biden-israel-palestinian- talks> to help jump start the peace process. but biden should have known that prime minister bibi netanyahu intended to upset his plans by netanyahu's appearance with john hagee. the day after a series of talks between us special envoy for the middle east george mitchell and netanyahu, and a day before biden's arrival, netanyahu appeared onstage with pastor john hagee in jerusalem. the occasion was hagee's night to honor israel, an event the far-right texas-based preacher arranged to tout his ministry's millions in donations to israeli organizations and to level bellicose rhetoric against israel's perceived enemies. at the gathering, hagee called iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad \"the hitler of the middle east\" and denounced the goldstone report as \"character assassination by an unbiased and uninformed committee.\" netanyahu welcomed the crowd of 1000 american evangelicals to jerusalem, a city he described as \"the undivided, eternal capitol of the jewish people. then, he told them, \"i salute you! the jewish people salute you!\" he used the rest of his speech to call for \"tough, biting sanctions\" against iran that \"bite deep into its energy sector.\" hagee and netanyahu appear together on stage: in the audience were top-level members of the israeli government, from ambassador michael oren to jerusalem mayor 'mr barkat to deputy foreign minister danny ayalon. also present was rabbi shlorno riskin, the chief rabbi of the illegal west bank settlement of efrat who gained notoriety for lobbying president bill clinton to pardon his friend, fugitive billionaire marc rich. ayalon had stirred controversy <http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1150484.html> days before when he refused to meet with a us congressional delegation brought to israel by the progressive jewish group j street. part one of hagee's

film highlighting the recipients of donations from john hagee ministries that totaled $58 million since 2001. the recipients included jewish settlements from the west bank like gush etzion and shomron, which was involved in promoting an \"obama hilltop project\" <http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/277856,jewish-settlers-launch-obama-hilltop-project.html> that promoted more settlement building and compared obama to pharoah. hagee also announced funding for a pressure group run by the settlers evacuated from gush katif in gaza in 2005. during israel's assault on gaza in 2009, a group of gush katif residents lobbied <http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1054491.html> the israel government to allow them to resettle the palestinian coastal region. who is hagee funding in israel? who is hagee funding in israel? <http://vimeo.com/10027708> from max blumenthal <http://vimeo.com/user1924826> on vimeo <http://vimeo.com> . the most notable of hagee's funding recipients was an organization called im tirtzu. a student representative of this group appeared in the film to thank hagee for \"help[ing] us to ensure that students in israel are on the right path, the path of zionism, the love of israel, the path of solidarity.\" another student called for \"the second revolution in israel.\" in february, im tirtzu funding a smear campaign against former knesset member and new israel fund director naomi chazan <http://www.nif.org/meclia-center/press-releases/former-mk-naomi.html> that included posters caricaturing her with a horn on her head. the group misleadingly accused the new israel fund of bankrolling 16 human rights organizations that contributed documentation to the goldstone report. the smear campaign led to unsuccessful legislation in the knesset designed to further cripple already marginalized israeli human rights groups. meanwhile, the jerusalem post fired <http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1147783.html> chazan as a columnist without explanation. gideon levy, a columnist for ha'aretz, called <http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1148014.html> irn tirtzu \"a mccarthyite movement\" for its attacks on chazan. although cur attempted to distance itself <http://www.jpost.com/jewishworld/jewishnlews/article.aspx?id=167666> from im tirtzu's campaign, the organization's appearance during cur's jerusalem ceremony suggested that hagee would continue to provide it with funding well into the future. republican senator john mccain repudiated the endorsement <http://www.cnn.corn/2008/politics/05/22/mccain.hagee/index.html> of hagee during his 2008 presidential campaign after hagee's statements describing the holocaust as a fulfillment of divine prophecy came to light. hagee has also said that <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/max-blumenthal/pastor-hagee-the-antichri_b_104608.html> he believed the anti-christ was \"partially jewish, as was adolph hitler.\" however, none of hagee's comments have deterred israeli government officials from embracing him or accepting his millions in annual charity. during hagee's speech, he made no secret of his support for the illegal settlement enterprise that has been the source of difficulties between the us and israel. \"the settlements are not the problem,\" he boomed from the podium. \"the problem is the refusal of arab leaders to respect the right of jewish people to live anywhere in the middle east.\" hagee received a rousing ovation from the crowd and the israeli government officials seated beside the podium when he proclaimed, \"world leaders do not have the authority to tell israel and the jewish people what they can and cannot do in the city of jerusalem. they don't have the authority to tell them what they can and cannot build, who can and and cannot live there.\" the following day, on march 9, vice president joseph biden arrived in israel to meet with netanyahu and officials from the palestinian authority. he told reporters <http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1155106.html> after touching down that he saw \"a moment of real opportunity.\" <http://www.amazon.com/talking-terrorists-america-engage-enemies/dp/0465011179>

they like to build up their arms and overall strength. but once in war, they want only more troops, fewer restrictions on their use, and above all, victory, victory, victory. since vietnam, they smell only vacillation among democrats, and they don't like it. for their part, democrats see insubordination and worse among the military toward them, and they don't care for the suits either. it's not a happy circumstance. woodward didn't explore this underlying reality, which is critical for americans to understand. breakad the white house clash with the military could get worse over the latest news about gen. stanley mcchrystal's firing over naughty things said about the white house to a reporter. according to a preliminary army investigation, the generaland unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05773961 date: 08/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05773961 date: 08/31/2015 perhaps even his senior army aideswere not the sources of those nasty quotes. it was some other guysyou know, the usual culprits, the navy and civilians. there will be further formal inquiries on this, but nothing good will come of them. there's another important thread running throughout the woodward account that, i believe, he gets more wrong than right. that is, woodward's repeated insistence of open and bitter policy brawls in the good old situation room (the inner sanctum for white house meetings) over afghan policy. mr. instant historian paints a picture of a war of all against all. my information has always been that there was relative agreement on major policy. based on my sources, there is no doubt that secretary of state hillary clinton, defense secretary bob gates, and joint chiefs chairman mike mullen were almost always quite cordial and in full lock step. they, along with the nsc adviser jim jones and field commanders like general mcchrystal and general petraeus, are the key players. of course, vice president joe biden and chief of staff rahm emanuel were the only regular critics of where policy was heading. the generals did lobby for their positions in publicin advance of presidential decisions. and that's a big no-no. but by that standard, almost all obama's top advisers did as much. the day after his west point speech last december, where he set the firm date of july 2011 to begin unspecified u.s. troop withdrawals, almost all the advisers publicly stated that maybe one didn't have to take this date too seriously, that everything was \"conditions based.\" that group of rebels included gates and clinton. so, if anything, most of obama's top counselors were more or less unitedsometimes against where he seemed to be going. here is what petraeus had to say to woodward on the subject of goals, and it's a stunner: \"you have to recognize also that i don't think you win this war. i think you keep fighting. it's a little bit like iraq, actually.... yes, there has been enormous progress in iraq. but there are still horrific attacks in iraq, and you have to stay vigilant. you have to stay after it. this is the kind of fight we're in for the rest of our lives and probably our kids' lives.\" the brilliant general said as much to others over the last year. it's enough to knock your socks off. so far, there are no heroes to this narrative, only self-described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight on forever. doubtless, president obama does not want to fight an open-ended war. he's sworn to that time and again, and i believe him, despite his history of calling for \"victory\" and \"defeat\" of the taliban and al qaeda. but what the woodward book demonstrates is that obama and his team just don't know how to get from here to there. so far, there are no heroes to this narrative, only self-described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight on forever. leslie h. gelb, a former new york times columnist and senior government official, is author of power rules: how common sense can rescue american foreign policy (harpercollins 2009), a book that shows how to think about and use power in the 21st century. he is president emeritus of the council on foreign relations. get a head start with the morning scoop email. it's your cheat sheet with must reads from across the web. get it. for inquiries, please contact the daily beast at editorialthedailybeast.com. al: http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-09-23/bob-woodwards-obamas-wars-les-gelb-on-who-got- burned/p/ <img src=\"http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?c1=28tc2=6433482&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=1.3&cj=1\" styleedisplay:none\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" alt=\" i> unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05773961 date: 08/31/2015  "

\"that wasn't a surprise,\" he adds, in a matter-of-fact manner. \"the bigger the bubble, the bigger the burst. \"the thing most economists did not fully grasp was the extent to which the banks engaged in murky risk-taking activities. they were taking a risk with our money, their shareholders' money, the bond-holders' money,\" he says. banks were demanding up to 40 per cent of the corporate profits, saying their innovative financing was adding value. but \"all this talk about innovation was a sham\" because it did not relate to any real increase in the economy's productivity, he says. \"there was a prima facie case of something screwy going on [with all the] perverse incentives that would lead them to take excessive risk. but there was no way anyone could know or believe that the banks were [conducting themselves] at that level of stupidity. i predicted that there was going to be a collapse because of the information asymmetry problems that were being created.\" his nobel prize was given for exactly that - showing how markets fail because different people in them hold different levels of information. yet there is no hint of i-told-you-so about stiglitz's tone as he asks the unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05770101 date: 08/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05770101 date: 08/31/2015 waiter for coffee. he orders decaffeinated, but suggests the british economy needs the opposite: a stiff stimulant rather than the \"fiscal consolidation\" which is george osborne's economic euphemism for cuts. fiscal stimulus is out of fashion now. world leaders embarked on that strategy - injecting money to re-energise the economy - after the banking crash three years ago. it was widely perceived not to have worked because the money governments pumped into the banks was not passed on to ailing businesses or individuals in trouble with their mortgages. \"the problem was that, in the us, the stimulus wasn't big enough,\" he says. \"too much of it was in tax cuts. and when they gave.money to the banks they gave it to the wrong banks and, as a result, credit has not been restored - we can expect a couple of million or more homes to be repossessed this year than last year - and the economy has not been restarted.\" instead of producing a consensus that the government should have done more, it has created disillusion that the government can do anything, stiglitz says. the result is that, following the attacks by the financial markets on greece and then spain, everybody is now in a mood of retrenchment. \"it's not just pre-keynesian, it's hooverite,\" he says. by which he means governments are not just refusing to stimulate, they are making cuts, as herbert hoover did in the us in 1929 - when he turned the wall street crash into the great depression. \"hoover had this idea that, whenever you go into recession, deficits grow, so he unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05770101 date: 08/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05770101 date: 08/31/2015 decided to go for cuts - which is what the foolish financial markets that got us into this trouble in the first place now want.\" it has become the new received wisdom throughout europe. but it is the classic error made by those who confuse a household's economics with those of a national economy. \"if you have a household that can't pay its debts, you tell it to cut back on spending to free up the cash to pay the debts. but in a national economy, if you cut back on your spending, then economic activity goes down, nobody invests, the amount of tax you take goes down, the amount you pay out in unemployment benefits goes up - and you don't have enough money to pay your debts. \"the old story is still true: you cut expenditures and the economy goes down. we have lots of experiments which show this, thanks to herbert hoover and the imf,\" he adds. the imf imposed that mistaken policy in korea, thailand, indonesia, argentina and hosts of other developing countries in the 1980s and 1990s. \"so we know what will happen: economies will get weaker, investment will get stymied and it's a downward vicious spiral. how far down we don't know - it could be a japanese malaise. japan did an experiment just like this in 1997; just as it was recovering, it raised vat and went into another recession.\" then why have we not learned from all that? because politicians like george osborne are driven by ideology; the national deficit is an excuse to shrink the state because that is what he wanted anyway. because the financial market only unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05770101 date: 08/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05770101 date: 08/31/2015 cares about one thing - getting repaid. and because other european governments are panicking because of the market's wild attack on greece and spain, and they don't want to be next. \"but cutbacks in germany, britain and france will mean all of europe will suffer. the cuts will all feed back negatively. and if everyone follows this policy, their budget deficits will get worse, so they will have to make more cuts and raise taxes more. it's a vicious downward spiral. we're now looking at a long, hard, slow recovery with the possibility of a double dip if everybody cuts back at the same time. the best scenario is long and hard ... and the worst is much worse. if any one of these countries is forced into default, the banking system is so highly leveraged that it could cause real problems. this is really risky, really scary.\" so what should we be doing? \"the lesson is not that you cut back spending, but that you redirect it. you cut out the war in afghanistan. you cut a couple of hundred billion dollars of wasteful military expenditure. you cut out oil . subsidies. there's a long list of things we can cut. but you increase spending in other areas, such as research and development, infrastructure, education\" - areas where government can get a good return on the investment of public money. \"i haven't done the calculation for britain, but, for the us, all you need is a return on government investment of 5 to 6 per cent and the long-term deficit debt is lowered.\" unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05770101 date: 08/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05770101 date: 08/31/2015 taxes also need to be restructured. osborne has increased capital gains tax for high earners from 18 to 28 per cent. \"there's absolutely no reason why you couldn't tax speculative gains [from rising house or land prices] by 40 per cent. there's no social return on it and land is going to be there whether people have speculated or not. but you lower the tax on investment in things like r&d.\" stiglitz has one more practical solution to offer. governments should set up their own banks to restart lending to businesses and save struggling homeowners from repossession. \"if the banks aren't lending, let's create a new lending facility to do that job,\" he says. \"in the us, we gave $700bn to the banks; if we had used a fraction of that to create a new bank, we could have financed all the lending that was needed.\" indeed, it could be done for far less. \"tak $100bn, lever that at 10 to 1 [by attracting funds from the private sector] and that's a trillion-dollar new lending capacity - more than the real economy needs.\" such a move would help ordinary people more than all osborne's rhetoric about being tough but fair. stiglitz is sceptical, too, about the moral underpinning of a budget which claims that \"we are all in this together\", but then hits the poorest hardest. analysis by the institute for fiscal studies has suggested that the chancellor's budget will cost the poor 2.5 per cent of their income, while the rich will lose unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05770101 date: 08/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05770101 date: 08/31/2015 just 1 per cent. \"i've not made an independent study on that point, but cuts in public services will have a disproportionate effect on the poor,\" stiglitz says. osborne's budget \"may be well-intentioned, but it takes an enormous amount of work to make sure that a package of public spending cuts of that magnitude doesn't hit the poor disproportionately\". his big fear is that overseas aid, which has been protected in this first round of cuts, will not escape a second. \"developing countries have redirected themselves towards asia, and china in particular, in recent years, so growth in africa will be more robust than one might have expected, given the severity of the downturn,\" he says. even so, aid remains vital to poor countries. \"if aid is cut back, growth will be badly affected,\" he says. \"china is providing aid, but its aid is all in infrastructure, whereas aid from the us and europe is mainly in education and health - areas in which ordinary people will suffer most if there are cuts.\" joseph stiglitz has come full circle. what the world needs now - developing and developed - is not retrenchment but greater economic stimulus. it is not a message many are in the mood to hear. but they didn't listen to him last time, either. and he turned out to be right, and they were wrong - and at what a cost to us all. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05770101 date: 08/31/2015  "

(please see attached rimed document.) the government has appropriated 330 million euros for this initiative. further, upmc is a consultant to the italian government and is in negotiations with the regional governments in milan and florence. our international offices are in rome.  upmc's relationship with prime minister berlusconi: (a.) upmc has had a long term and stable relationship in italy over the past ten years, including two governments led by prime minister berlusconi. he is knowledgeable about upmc, as is giarmi letta, italian council of ministry under secretary. (b.) the rimed initiative was conceived during his previous term of office and in 2005, the letter of intent for rimed was personally signed by prime minister berlusconi and mr. jeffrey a. romoff, president of upmc. (c.) it was under the berlusconi administration that the decision was made to fund rimed and 330 million euros were appropriated for this purpose. mr. romoff participated in a press conference at palazzo chigi with the prime minister. (d.) recently, because of the devastating earthquake and the economic downturn, the resources to fund rimed have become constrained, but it is felt this is simply an issue of an unexpected contingency, rather than any lack of interest and support. (e.) mr. romoff has met with prime minister berlusconi several times and is fluent in italian.

haiti - anothter idea -- much quicker ramp-up fyi sent: thursday, january 21, 2010 8:54 pm subject: griot education project in haiti - anothter idea -- much quicker ramp-up : after watching scenes on tv, talking w/ you and others, here is idea for nearly immediate way to get kids back 'in school' or into school for the first time. it would be very cheap, could get started very soonsay mid-february, could be linked to other distribution networks (food/medical supplies), and would be quite organic and grassroots. i'll call it the griot education project (in the west african tradition of a streetside storytellers). context/understanding: looks like there are a few hundred thousand kids in port-au-prince who pretty soon will be (already are) sitting around day-to-day w/ more or less nothing to do. their schools got destroyed, their neighborhoods in rough shape. these are young kids who would be best served if they could get out of the house for a few hours a day (possibly even freeing up parents to do rebuilding or other work), and not spend their time getting caught up in crime, or desperately searching through rubble for a mal to eat... and get back to school, and engage their naturally curious brains. the goal of this program is to immediately give them a place to go, a chance to interface with an energetic educator, and at least expose them to relevant, skill-enhancing academic work that engages them while we rebuild education infrastructure. it also would likely get them 1 meal each day, and if needed a way to get referred for immediate medical attention. griot educators: we recruit and equip a cadre of teachers who will go out into communities with a set of portable materials each moming- educators who after a few days will find a place to teach, and will have attracted class of students. this is modeled off the street artist/storyteller. we flyer the neighborhoods, advertising teaching positions. we work w/ whoever we can find who can help us identify people who were good teachers prior to the earthquake and/or people who have the abilty to attract kids (appropriately). we select teachers. we agree to pay them a daily/weekly stipend. we want people who know their communities, who don't need a lot of direction, who will take a cart full of educational materials, find a corner, or abandoned building and start teaching to whoever shows up. people who will do anything to get some young kids to try to read or do some math problems or sing songs and write poetry... education supply centers we set up education supply centers and a distribution system. each center is staffed by small team-1 lead person is an education-leader, others are admin and support. griots come the center in the morning, they get a day's worth of educational materials (we select it, we photocopy it, we give them 50 pencils, etc.). we agree to send over 50 meals two hours later. each griot wheels his portable classroom to his/her spot and sets up shop... kids come, and he/she teaches. it builds momentum and kids get off the streets, out of their homes and come to the morning 'school' site. kids who come get a meal. maybe we end up w/ 3 tiers of griots-1 who works w/ 4, 5, 6 year olds, 1 with 7, 8, 9 year olds, 1 with 10, 11, 12 year olds. each one picks up a packet of material that is more or less appropriate for that age group. all this is incredibly flexible and fluid. maybe one morning session and then an after lunch session. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05769288 date: 08/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05769288 date: 08/31/2015 the education supply centers are warehouses we set up. they have copiers, lots of paper, basic school supplies, some art supplies, etc. (over time, maybe people donate a bunch of books or magazines, etcthey become ways for artists, volunteers, entertainers to connect w/ kids, as well.) each morning a group of griots go to their supply centers and pick up materials, and fill up their cart... and roll down the block, or blocks and set up their 'school' for the day. maybe someone wants to donate a bunch of art supplies, or harmonicaswho knowswhatever it takes to get kids to show up and do some academic and enrichment activities. these education supply centers likely get linked to other distribution hubs. this way they can get linked w/ food or other supplies. longer-term/setting the stage for longer-term ramp up over time, some of the griots will end up running little schools that start to feel permanent. kids will bring in chairs and stools...maybe some of the teaching material ends up staying at the school sites, and the end up as likely places for folks to build/rebuild schools. but in the near term, the 'school' is whatever spot the griot goes to where he/she can attract a cadre of kidsand the good news is that can be almost anywhere. this program is cheap -- as costly as it is to pay stipends to the griots, plus the cost of supplies, delivery, and some human capital to man the supply centers, develop/acquire high interest, high educational value material. i think quite cheap, and could easily be costed out once we knew about how much we need to pay a griot for a day of teaching. it also gets some folks working, immediately. some griots would take stipend and not teach; some wouldn't do it well; some would pawn off the food/biscuits...but we could weed much of that out and w/ this sort of approach, you don't let a few bad apples spoil the larger program (or fear of them stop it from getting started). this program is about planting the seeds for the future schools to come, about getting young kids off streets and stoops and into a fun/learning environment, about empowering talented teacher-artists to go out into their communities armed w/ some basic materials, their good will, their creativity (and a paycheck)together the kids and the griots will find local places to call and claim as their schools. and while this is going on, we have time to build out infrastructure (human capital, facilities, instructional/curricular materials) for more robust ramp-up over time. per usual, feel free to ignore or pass on. dd unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05769288 date: 08/31/2015  "

(for example, in this same speech sharon makes clear israel views the roadmap commitments as sequential - the palestinians do everything they have to do, and only then does israel act. ) apparently so. but it gets better. for further evidence, elliott asserts that, really, the us agreed with everything sharon was saying. his evidence? exhibit b: a letter from arid sharon's chief of staff, dov weissglas, secretary of state rice.. it is like saying \"your honor, i swear my client did not sideswipe that car in the parking lot. i was there and i saw the whole thing. and as proof i give you my statement and a statement from my client and his wife, written to the owner of the damaged car, making clear that they were not the ones who hit his car. i rest my case.\" so there are not quotes from president bush or secretary rice to support elliott's narrative - only statements by israeli officials. but elliot has more proof to bring before the court: media reports. exhibit "

'when westeriaers finally came to saudi arabia, we came not as the vindicators of our presumed cultural superiority, but as hired help. as a result, some say that saudis secretly see the world's peoples as divided into two basic categories: (1) fellow saudis; and (2) potentita employees. 'be that as it may, foreigners, western, asian, or /krab, who have lived in sliudi arabi.a all see it as a -very strange place  one that is riot easy to itnclerstand and that remains at odds with many of the values non-saudis profess. the kingdom has long stood apart from global norms. its system of government draws on tribal and islamic traditions rather than western models. its king presides rather than rules over the royal family and saudi society. his responsibility is less to make decisions than to shape and proclaim consensus, while assuring a share of the national wealth to all. especially the leas;. 1ri.a.7ilege(. saudi arabia levies no taxes 011 t s citizens, other than the religious tithe known as \"zakat\" a two-and-a-half percent annual donation of private capital to charity and oilier public purposes. all saudis ,njoy free education and medi cal care fro piti rth to cleath and can pursue these sen, ices at home of abroad.. as they wish. the kingdom has no parliament. though it does have elaborate informal mechanisms for consultation with its citizens on policy matters. saudi arabia reverses and thereby affirms a basic principle of american political philosophy. \"no representation without taxation.\" unlike some other countries in the arab gulf, saudi .nra.bia has invested its oil wealth at home, not abroad, ii it it ilas long been generous v,fith foreign aid.

(that is a low figure compared to our own but represents a remarkable advance for the kingdom.) one- -third of civil service positions have !peen reserved -for women. the first woman took her seat i.n the co modof ministers hist year. after a bit cilia kerfuffie, the .i',.iingdom's religious scholars ifinally endorsed coeducation at the new king abdullah univershv for science and technology. that was big blow to the 'legitimacy of gender apartheid. a saudi friend and i are betting that it will not be long before women in the kingdom can drive. we plan to clean up by building the separate road system tins may require. (that's a joke, i hope,) a word about the vision embodied in the king abdullah university for science and technology. founded by the king last septernber with an initial endowment of ten billion dollars. kaust is an international, graduate- level research university. it sits in a two-billion-dollar campus on the red sea about seventy-five miles northwest of mecca. on one level, it is the leading element in an effort to prepare the kingdom for a knowledge-based economy that can complement and eventually supercede the current reliance on energy exports. but on another level, it is a powerful answer to the religious zealotry that terrorist movements like al qa'ida espouse. let me explain. there is a broad consensus among the world's 1.6 billion muslims that the modern age is ethically corrupt and that religious faith needs reinvigoration and renewal. much like early christian protestants, many believe that the way to achieve this is to rediscover and reaffirm the values of their religion's earliest times. when he inaugurated kaust, king abdullah explained that he envisaged it as a reborn bayt al-hikma or \"house of wisdom.\" the original \"house of wisdom\" was founded in baghdad around 760 ce., in the second century of the muslim era. it was where the arabs incorporated greek, indian and other foreign knowledge into islam and conceived much of modern mathematics, astronomy, medicine, chemistry, zoology, and geography. it made islamic civilization the global leader in science and technology. the \"house of wisdom\" prospered in an age of tolerance, when jews and christians served alongside muslims as ministers of government. though unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05767140 date: 08/31/2015 unclassified u.s.

sparked the renaissance. today, like mainstream muslims, the extremists of al qa'ida and related movements argue that islam must return to its roots. but they portray early islam as puritanical, xenophobic, intolerant, and oppressive of women.. kaust is a living rebuttal of this historical fallacy and the ideology of hatred derived from it. it was conceived as a new \"house of wisdom.\" it stands for the principle that islam was founded as and can only be reborn as the religious guide to a society open to ideas from other traditions. it represents a call for return to an islam tolerant of foreign ways, respectful of women, dedicated to the scientific study of god's handiwork, and committed to the development of new technologies to better the human condition. kaust is as much an instrument of religious renaissance and an answer to extremism as it is an academic institution. this brings me to the issue of religious tolerance. in 2003, king abdullah inaugurated what he called a \"national forum for intellectual dialogue.\" this ongoing national dialogue is an unprecedented acceptance of religious diversity in the kingdom. it marks an end to longstanding official discrimination against its shiite minority. in 2007, king abdullah made an historic call on the pope in the vatican, the first time a muslim leader of his stature had done so. in 2008 he organized two unprecedented international interfaith conferences between muslims, jews, christians. buddhists, and others at madrid and new york. he intends this dialogue, too, to be a continuing process. there are other major domestic reform initiatives in progress, like a complete revamping of the saudi educational system and curriculum, experiments with elections at lower levels of government and civil society, efforts to shift the kingdom toward reliance on alternative sources of energy, the development of a huge new petrochemical industry to complement the production of energy in its primary form. time will not permit me to describe these developments. my point is simply that there is a great deal more going on in saudi arabia than our press and pundits seem to realize. that said, everything is, of course, relative. sadly, to many saudis, the history of their nation suggests that the more religiously uptight they are, the more oil comes out of the ground. the kingdom continues in many ways to belie god's admonition in the holy ()limn that \"there can be no compulsion in religion.\" the open practice of religions other than islam remains banned. the status and role of wonien in &tudi society is controversial and far from settled. despite efforts at \"saudiization,\" foreign workers continue to dominate the employment market, while demanding a premium to compensate for the discomfort and stress that saudi arabia's religiously sanctioned mores impose on them. methods of political consultation that worked in a more cohesive and less populous saudi arabia can no longer produce consensus. the fiscal basis of the state continues to be oil exports, and oil is a commodity whose price fluctuates unpredictably. there is, in other words, a very long list of problems for saudis to work out in coming years. let me turn briefly to saudi arabia's foreign relations before reviewing the state of our country's interaction with it. in foreign even more than domestic affairs, king abdullah's impact has been little short of revolutionary. he has overseen the negotiated settlement of the kingdom's long-disputed borders with all of its neighbors. he brought saudi arabia into the world trade organization, ensuring that its trade arid investment activities for the first time follow internationally agreed rules. in 1982, at beirut, he led the arab league in an historic reversal. of policy toward the israel-palestine issue. saudi arabia had long insisted that it would be the last state in the region to recognize and establish relations with israel. at beirut, king abdullah committed to be the first to normalize relations with israel upon its achievement of a mutually acceptable arrangement for coexistence with the palestinians. he persuaded all other arab countries to promise they would do the same. to his great frustration. israel did not respond. since then, hope for a two-state solution that could gain acceptance for israel in the region has dimmed.

saudi arabia's foreign policy challenges stem from recent american policies in the region. these policies have had the effect of liberating israel from all constraints on its settlement activities and belligerent intervention in its arab neighbors, installing iran as the dominant political influence in both iraq and lebanon, consolidating rather than eroding the syrian-iranian alliance, pushing hama.s into the arms of the iranians, and raising regional tensions over tehran's nuclear program while doing nothing effective about it. then there is afghanistan, where the united states now seems to be engaged in a crusade against militant islam  one that many in the region now fear may soon extend to yemen. saudi counter-terrorism specialists, who have a well- deserved international reputation for effectiveness, are convinced that the most efficient way to radicalize muslim populations and encourage terrorism against the united states and its foreign policy partners is to invade, occupy, and humiliate them. they believe that the panick.ed militarism of the u.s. response to 9/11 was exactly what groups like al qa'ida, hoped for. they see no sign that the united states is about to abandon actions and policies that metastasize extremism and stimulate terrorist reprisal against americans and our foreign friends. no longer willing to be publicly associated with u.s. policies in the holy land, iraq, afghanistan, and elsewhere that radicalize the region and menace the kingdom's own security, saudi arabia is actively attempting to reduce its historic dependence on america. to this end, it is building new relationships with countries like china, india, and. russia, while strengthening cooperation with longstanding partners in europe and asia like britain, france, germany, japan, and south korea. it is not that the kingdom has given up on the united states. as the king's scholarship program for saudi students in this country evidences., saudi arabia continues to reach out and seek improved relations with america. but saudis no longer trust us to take their interests into account or to protect them from their enemies. in december 2002, as the u.s. prepared to invade iraq against the forcefully expressed advice of then crown prince abdullab, saudi aramco (the world's largest oil company) quietly abandoned a decades-old subsidy for the cost of shipping oil to the north american market. within months, china replaced the united states as the kingdom's biggest overseas market for oil. u.s. exports have remained relatively constant as the saudi arabian economy has boomed, dramatically' reducing our market share in our largest middle eastern market. ironically, the best element of the us-saudi relationship is now cooperation against terrorists. this is a task in which the saudis have perforce learned to excel. american policies ensure an endless supply of angry young muslim men in the region, including in saudi arabia. the united states is now said to have entered a \"long war.\" the last time we did so, in 1947 with soviet communism the enemy was obvious, george ketman gave us a strategy, and skillful american diplomacy gave us the allies we needed to pursue it. kennan's \"long telegram\" from moscow outlined a comprehensive approach to the political, economic, cultural, and military containment of the threat to our survival and our values posed by the soviet union. we followed his outline. forty years later, as kerman forecast, without our having to go to war with the ussr, ohr soviet enemy collapsed of its own infirmities. this time, our \"long war\" is with various islamic extremists, tribes, sects, and societies. were not quite sure who our enemy is. no k.ennan has emerged to give us a strategy for winning without fighting or, indeed, any \"strategy\" at all. instead, we are flailing about with our superbly lethal military in response to events. lacking a strategy, we have been unable to recruit foreign partners to support one. we are now alone in iraq. we are isolated internationally on the israel-palestine issue. our nato allies are with us in afghanistan out of consideration for nato, not because they think we know what we are doing. many of them have already announced their intention to withdraw-. pakistan is with us only because all its alternatives are worse. saudi arabia and america head al qaida's enemies list. the kingdom has, however, been successfully vilified in the eyes of the american elite and public. to deal effectively with islamic extremism, we need muslim allies. there is none more potent that the kingdom of saudi arabia. yet we have made no effort to seek its advice about how to address the challenges of islamic extremism. we have not sought its help to legitimize an unclassified u.s.

vision for kaust  suggest that such a partnership with saudi arabia and arab nations of like mind is possible. such a partnership could be the basis for a strategy to bring victory- in this latest \"long war.\" the common interests on which to forge an alliance are clearly there. last june in cairo, president obama brilliantly articulated a credible basis for sound relations with the islamic world. his vision was persuasive, but it remains a mirage, not a reality. et is past time to implement it. an intensive effort to reset the relationship with saudi arabia and to craft a common antiterrorist strategy with its king would be a good place to start. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05767140 date: 08/31/2015  "

the weight of history (always felt by germans); the contribution of the us and the salience of the western alliance; the meaning of 1989 to today and especially the continuity of the western alliance; and segue from past to future. what i have not done here but might be added are references to angela merkel (a courageous woman from the east who embodies the highest values of the west); and specific policies. those can be fitted in. so, some ideas and language: twenty years ago the wall fell. here, in berlin, the moment when tens of thousands of citizens tore it down with hammers and picks and bare hands is called \"die wende,\" a phrase that means more than simply a change but a turning point in history. it was not only a turning point for germany and europe but also for the united states because the wallthe reason for its construction and the reason for its destructionis central to our common historyand to our common future. richard von weizsaecker said, \"as long as the brandenburg gate is closed, the german question will remain open.\" today i can say with finality, the german question is closed, because the brandenburg gate is wide open! the gate is open, europe is open, and our future together is open. in the forty years from the berlin airlift to the fall of the berlin wall, the atlantic partnership proved itself the most successful alliance for freedom in history. that alliance was, is and shall be the crowning achievement of american foreign policy. and the german  american relationship has always served as its foundation. our alliance represents the unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05765213 date: 07/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05765213 date: 07/31/2015 reconciliation of former enemies, an inspiration to other peoples and continents devastated by war and hatred, and it must never be taken for granted. in the twenty years since the fall of the wall we have created architecture for an enduring peace. instead of a wall we have built a gateway to the future. president kennedy said in 1963 that in the future free men everywhere will say, \"ich bin ein berliner.\" today berlin has gained a new and even more powerful meaning. forever into the future, the opening of this gate will be the symbol of the return of the dream of freedom, not only to berlin and germany, but to the entire world. the gate, we must remember, was not built as a symbol of freedom. and each of the tyrannies that used the gate as a symbol believed it represented their eternal power. the gate was first erected as a symbol against the french revolution; then it became a symbol of the imperial ambitions of napoleon who marched his army through. it was a symbol of prussian militarism and monarchy. it was seized by the nazi party as the symbol of its 1000 year rule. and then it became a symbol of the communist totalitarianism that built a wall to separate the people of berlin as though freedom could be contained in only one part of the city. here, in berlin, the cold war was coldest. we celebrate the fact that the wall that marred this proud city was taken down by the world's most enthusiastic wrecking crew. the united states always believed in the freedom of berlin because we believed in the future of freedom. the courageous citizens of east germany, poland and other nations of the communist bloc demonstrated their dedication to free and peaceful solution of conflicts through their stand against dictatorship. america stood resolutely as an ally at every moment of this struggle and moved swiftly to help the peoples of europe reunite after 1989. we celebrate the steadiness of purpose, the restraint and respect for ultimate goals that allowed the cold war to end in peace. for how the victory was won was essential to the triumph. 1989 was special. it was that rarest of historical events: a revolution that did not descend into violence. as a result the gate survives not as a cautionary monument to history's darkest moments but to its brightest. today we celebrate the revolution of 1989, the turning point that transformed the brandenburg gate into the symbol of the hope of democracy and the promise of freedom. berliner luft, the air of berlin, has always been unique. i can feel and smell the spirit of freedom in your streets. the great american poet carl sandburg called berlin the chicago of europe. chicago is where i was born and raised. i can sense the same energy, openness and dedication to hard work in both great cities. another chicagoan, president barack obama, was drawn to berlin last july, a city that he said made him feel like a citizen of the world and a citizen of the future. i was very proud to visit our new embassy at the brandenburg gate, located exactly where the wall used to run. our presence here will forever underscore our determination that the spark of freedom from this city in 1989 will help light the torches of freedom throughout the world. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05765213 date: 07/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05765213 date: 07/31/2015 the revolution of 1989 did not mark the end of history. having made history together, we are summoned to secure freedom for future generations. as vital at the beginning of the 21st century as it was in the last half of the 20th, the western alliance is called to new tasks. the dreams of 1989 reached farand have farther to reach. old hatreds and conflictsin the balkins, the caucauses, in the middle east, east asia, and africastill simmer. we have much to demonstrate what we have learned from the last century. without freedom, without the rule of law, without the opportunity for people to support themselves and their families  without basic human rights-- anger, aggression and violence will prevail. today we are faced with difficult and often dangerous conflicts arising not from conflicts between nations but within them, conflicts exploited by zealots who make the false claim that violence will purify the world and open the gates of heaven. once zealots tried to use this gate to symbolize that message. but through the courage and determination of the people of berlin and their stalwart allies, this gate now stands for a true revolution of the spirit. the long twilight struggle to tear down this wall to make europe whole and free inspires us, in this new century, to help other peoples gain the same measure of security, respect and progress. we need berlin more than ever today. we need your courage, your fortitude, your commitment to the rights of men and womenwe need your example. we are hardly at the end of the history of the west. standing here, where a wall once stood but is no more, in the light from the gate, we have learned from history's deepest lessons. our alliance, linked by shared struggle, dedicated to the ideals of freedom and democracy, strong from the world we have built, now faces a new world of challenges. and we are ready to meet and conquer them. we know it has been done before. we are free menand womenand proud to say, we are all berliners. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05765213 date: 07/31/2015  "

he has ordered guantanamo closed within a year; he has set himself firmly against torture. he has, as the world and this newspaper wanted, taken a less strident tone in dealing with friends and rivals alike. but at home mr obama has had a difficult start. his performance has been weaker than those who endorsed his candidacy, including this newspaper, had hoped. many of his strongest supportersliberal columnists, prominent donors, democratic party stalwartshave started to question him. as for those not so beholden, polls show that independent voters again prefer republicans to democrats, a startling reversal of fortune in just a few weeks. mr obama's once-celestial approval ratings are about where george bush's were at this stage in his awful presidency. despite his resounding electoral victory, his solid majorities in both chambers of congress and the obvious goodwill of the bulk of the electorate, mr obama has seemed curiously feeble. empty posts, weak policies 6 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05760667 date: 06/30/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05760667 date: 06/30/2015 there are two main reasons for this. the first is mr obama's failure to grapple as fast and as single-mindedly with the economy as he should have done. his stimulus package, though huge, was subcontracted to congress, which did a mediocre job: too much of the money will arrive too late to be of help in the current crisis. his budget, though in some ways more honest than his predecessor's, is wildly optimistic. and he has taken too long to produce his plan for dealing with the trillions of dollars of toxic assets which fester on banks' balance-sheets. the failure to staff the treasury is a shocking illustration of administrative drift. there are 23 slots at the department that need confirmation by the senate, and only two have been filled. this is not the senate's fault. mr obama has made a series of bad picks of people who have chosen or been forced to withdraw; and it was only this week that he announced his candidates for two of the department's four most senior posts. filling such jobs is always a tortuous business in america, but mr obama has made it harder by insisting on a level of scrutiny far beyond anything previously attempted. getting the treasury team in place ought to have been his first priority. second, mr obama has mishandled his relations with both sides in congress. though he campaigned as a centrist and promised an era of post-partisan government, that's not how he has behaved. his stimulus bill attracted only three republican votes in the senate and none in the house. this bodes ill for the passage of more difficult projects, such as his big plans for carbon-emissions control and health-care reform. keeping those promises will soon start to bedevil the administration. the republicans must take their share of the blame for the breakdown. but if mr obama had done a better job of selling his package, and had worked harder at making sure that republicans were included in drafting it, they would have found it more difficult to oppose his plans. if mr obama cannot work with the republicans, he needs to be certain that he controls his own party. unfortunately, he seems unable to. put bluntly, the democrats are messing him around. they are pushing pro-trade-union legislation (notably a measure to get rid of secret ballots) even though he doesn't want them to do so; they have been roughing up the bankers even though it makes his task of fixing the economy much harder; they have stuffed his stimulus package and his appropriations bill with pork, even though this damages him and his party in the eyes of the electorate. worst of all, he is letting them get away with it. lead, dammit there are some signs that mr obama's administration is learning. this week the battered treasury secretary, tim geithner, has at last come up with a detailed plan to rescue the banks (see article and article). its success is far from guaranteed, and the mood of congress and the public has soured to the point where, should this plan fail, getting another one off the drawing-board will be exceedingly hard. but the plan at least demonstrates the administration's acceptance that it must work with the bankers, instead of riding the wave of popular opinion against them, if it is to repair america's economy. and it's not just in the domestic arena that mr obama has demonstrated his willingness to learn: on iraq, he has intelligently recalibrated his views, coming up with a 7 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05760667 date: 06/30/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05760667 date: 06/30/2015 plan for withdrawal that seeks to consolidate the gains in iraq while limiting the costs to america. but mr obama has a long way to travel if he is to serve his countryand the worldas he should. take the g20 meeting in london, to which he will head at the end of next week. the most important task for this would-be institution is to set itself firmly against protectionism at a time when most of its members are engaged in a game of creeping beggar-thy-neighbour. yet how can mr obama lead the fight when he has just pandered to america's unions by sparking a minor trade war with mexico? and how can he set a new course for nato at its 60th-anniversary summit a few days later if he is appeasing his party with talk of leaving afghanistan? in an accomplished press conference this week, mr obama reminded the world what an impressive politician he can be. he has a capacity to inspire that is unmatched abroad or at home. he holds a strong hand when it comes to the democrats, many of whom owe their seats to his popularity at last year's election. now he must play it. copyright c) 2009 the economist newspaper and the economist group. all rights reserved. _ _ nora toiv office of the secretary 202-647-8633 8 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05760667 date: 06/30/2015  "

why can't we get what god has given us? that is the right to live as n beings and not negotiate with white southerners and not count the votes. just do the right thing,\" he said. after the forum, rangel insisted he was not smearing opponents as racists. \"what i'm saying is, if you watch the town-hall meetings, people were angry and did not care what the answer was to some of their questions. they were angry with their member of congress, period,\" he said. rangel's comments came less than two weeks after governor paterson claimed he has been the victim of a racist white media -- and also suggested that opposition to obama's plan is racially driven. the white house disagreed with paterson's comments. 120 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05764653 date: 07/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05764653 date: 07/31/2015 little league world series - staten island's little league team, the south shore nationals, made it to the little league world series, but they lost the title two weeks ago with a 4-1 loss to the southwest regional champs, mcallister park american, from san antonio. 9/11 - jay winuk, founder of the my good deed organization, and brother of 9/11 victim, glenn winuk, notified us that doj has finally award his brother the 9/11 heroes medal of valor. you were very supportive of jay's efforts and wrote letters to doj. glenn worked at a law firm near the wtc, but was also a volunteer ff. after helping to evacuate his building he went to the wtc area to help and unfortunately died when the south tower fell. senator schumer and rep pete king held a press conference on tuesday making the announcement at a park named in glenn's honor in their hometown of jericho, long island. fyi, jay will be at friday's 9/11 servicenation event. 121 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05764653 date: 07/31/2015  "

first of all he has time. he is not going to win or lose the war in the next year. like it or not he is stuck with mr karzai and he should get used to the idea. it is reasonable to suggest helping to produce a larger afghan army and police force but this cannot be done overnight. most military recruits are there for the money and are too malnourished even to wear american flack jackets. speeding up security training f or afghan police meant over the summer that terrified men, often on heroin, were being sent to man dangerous and isolated police posts with just three weeks training. many of them did not come back. one way obama could strengthen the afghan army and police is to make sure their men are paid properly. in kabul many facilities are being guarded by policemen earning $70 a month, which is not enough to live on unless supplemented with bribes. this contrasts with $250,000 a year paid to foreign consultants who lurk inside heavily defended compounds. paying the iraqi army properly really did make a difference in baghdad and might do the same in afghanistan where 40 per cent of men are unemployed. a difference is that iraqi oil revenues last year were $62 billion while the afghan government is dependent on foreign aid. the us and its allies will have to pay. it is carefully thought out measures like this that obama should be considering and not the panicky dispatch of us special forces or tens of thousand of more troops. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05764318 date: 07/31/2015  "

11:25arn you could tell it wasn't going well. the conversations with medvedev and putin were tense, the body language awkward. the speech at the new economic school laid an egg. the press seemed bored with the visit of america's rock star president. and as for real results, well, there weren't any. looking for explanations in an article clifford levy and ellen barry in today's new york times called \"in russia, obama's star power does not translate,\" a range of possible answers were rolled out: russians are jaded, russians don't go for u.s. political posturing, obama's speeches don't translate well, and, according to one person who ought to understand politics, a russian circus designer, \"russians are the smartest people in the unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439

of years of economic and political catastrophe.) somehow, the formula that has been working for barack obama since early in 2007 suddenly seems to have gone cold. it is not enough simply to be him or to roll out michelle and the girls (all of whom joined him in moscow...unlike say, his top two state department officials). what's more, it's not just russia. oh sure, the press still swoon in most corners of the world and crowds and political leaders still get all fluttery when first exposed to america's charming, thoughtful, intelligent, young president. but we are now starting to see what happens when being barack obama is not enough. we are now starting to see the shortcomings of the new administration's approach wherein the president has actually been the policy. he has said we had changed and offered himself as evidence. he has been what we have offered to friends in terms of visits, access and calls. he has been the headline grabber, the spokesperson, the new voice of america. he has enabled the administration to take inherited policies and wrap them in obama-paper with obama-glitter all over it and all of a sudden, the old was repackaged into appearing new. where there have been differences, as with the concept of engagement, the change has been sold as a difference between him and his predecessor, with his speeches describing what was new and the possibility of interacting with him being the potential pay- off. this played big during his early trips overseas, the novelty value was high and the eagerness to move on from the painful prior era was great. at the g20 meeting, at the summit of the americas, in cairo, the concept of \"president as policy\" seemed to be working. but now we see where it is not. not in russia. not with the iranians who are happy to accept engagement and anything else that will be given to them but no strings, please not with hugo chavez, who hammed it up with obama in trinidad but led his misfit chorus in reflexively hammering the united states after the coup in honduras. certainly not in north korea. it seems that having the president as policy works best with the people who are pre-disposed to like us and to some extent with the young and the disenfranchised. but with the hard cases, with our enemies, it falls painfully and dangerously flat. in these instances, the new president is discovering that something much more than personal diplomacy and smile from the genuinely appealing obama clan is needed. in these instances, we are going to need to go back to the drawing board and do the grunt work of foreign policy, the tough negotiations, the nuanced position changes, the threats, the cajoling. it's a very different game from american politics and, in fact, is often completely unconnected to it. what works here, very often does not play at all overseas. there is a problem with this new reality. it requires a coordinated, multi-tiered, high-functioning foreign policy establishment. it needs the state department to be in a central role. it needs the nsc to work both as a policy development and policy implementation mechanism and the national security advisor to be seen and respected.. .like the secretary of state.. .as key advisors. it requires that the foreign policy of the united states is not centered too heavily either the president or the executive office of the president -- although the president will always remain the ultimate key. it is perfectly appropriate for the president to be part of the product, part of the rewards offered, and the mastermind...but he needs to move beyond campaign mode to something new. it is much akin to the entrepreneur of a successful company recognizing that for the company to grow further, to become a mature organization, he is going to need a mature structure that depends less on him and more on delegation of power to effective lieutenants and their teams. we're not there yet. the secretary of state and the state department have been visibly marginalized. she has become a kind of behind the scenes player. she's not on the sunday morning shows. the president or the vice president handles the big media assignments (often not sounding exactly like they were on the same page). the national security advisor, for all his personal strengths, is viewed as a bit of a lost cause five months into the presidency. one of his predecessors in the job said to me when asked whether he viewed general jones as failing in the job, \"to me, on that issue, where there is smoke, there is fire.\" tom donilon, jones's deputy, is seen to be managing the nsc process. denis mcdonough and mark lippert, obama confidantes, are seen to be working closely with him and his inner office team (rahm emanuel, the vp, david axelrod, greg craig and others) to play the leading role in shaping policy. clearly neither hillary clinton nor jim jones is a weak person. but all power in the u.s. national security apparatus flows from the president.

suggests problems to come. it's time to move out of campaign mode and into governing mode. it's time recognize that it really does take a big team of empowered leaders to make the complex foreign policy of the u.s. work and evolve in the right directions. it's time to recognize that it does not reflect badly on the president if we all agree he cannot transform the world single handedly, that

protecting human rights is central to helping countries worldwide achieve the goal of reducing or eliminating poverty. calling her speech \"historic,\" cox said clinton's commitment to a broad spectrum of human rights offers new hope in solving the desperation caused by poverty. \"by advancing the idea that human rights, development and participatory and accountable governance, are goals that mutually reinforce one another, secretary clinton has charted a course of leadership recognizing the indivisibility of human rights that has been missing in our government's mission abroad and at home,\" said cox. \"her statement today is an essential foundation for relieving the suffering of billions in poverty, especially now when millions upon millions more people worldwide are experiencing economic hardship.\" \"we welcome secretary clinton's affirmation that the \"basics\" of well being -- food, shelter, health and education are not only human rights in and of themselves, but are also essential for the exercise of other human rights. only by addressing both freedom from want and freedom from fear will it be possible to achieve genuine development for all.\" cox, who attended secretary clinton's speech on the administration's 21st century human rights agenda at georgetown university, said he was especially grateful to hear secretary clinton outline her determination to

secretary clinton's commitment to stand with human rights defenders worldwide by shining a spotlight on their work and the legitimacy of their efforts. in her speech secretary clinton highlighted the work of women of zimbabwe arise, whose founders were recently honored at the white house, and noted the state department had sent high-level diplomatic missions to meet with aung san suu kyi in

secretary for raising the question of accountability abroad and at home. \"secretary clinton rightly identifies accountability as the centerpiece of any successful human rights agenda for the united states. but if the administration means what it says, then it needs to appoint a bipartisan commission to investigate the abuses connected to counterterrorism policies since september 11, 2001, follow through on the executive orders it already has committed to, close the prison at guantanamo and abide by international legal commitments to end torture.\" \"the administration can't insist that other countries adhere to human rights protections while continuing to detain people outside the rule of law at home,\" cox continued. \"discussion of human rights can't be an empty rebranding exercise. the administration should promptly bring charges against the guantanamo detainees who can be legitimately charged with a crime, and release the rest without further delay.\" to date, 116 individuals have already been cleared for release but remain unjustly detained in guantanamo. noting that in his nobel prize speech in oslo, president obama stated that \"no nation can insist that others follow the rules of the road if we are not willing to follow those rules ourselves,\" cox stated, \"amnesty international commends the administration for its commitment to engage closely on human rights. this is welcome change, but to make measurable progress we must prioritize accountability for torture, implementation of human rights treaties, a strong executive order on human rights, and the establishment of a national human rights commission.\" amnesty international is a nobel peace prize-winning grassroots activist organization with more than 2.2 million supporters, activists and volunteers in more

(source comment: according to very sensitive sources, the libyan rebels are concerned that aqim may also obtain spigott wire-guided anti-tank missiles and an unspecified number of russian anti-tank mines made of plastic and undetectable by anti-mine equipment. this equipment again was coming through niger and mali, and was intended for the rebels in libya. they note that aqim is very strong in this region of northwest africa.) in the opinion of these knowledgeable individuals, libyan rebel commanders are also concerned that the death of bin laden comes at a time when sensitive information indicates that the leaders of aqim are planning to launch attacks across north africa and europe in an effort to reassert their relevance during the ongoing upheavals in libya, as well as the rest of north africa and the middle east. they believe the first stop in this campaign was the april x) bombing of a cafe in marrakesh, morocco that is frequented by western tourists. these individuals point out that aqim also maintains a wide reach in europe. the inc leaders are also concerned that, with the death of salt al-arab qaddafi, the youngest son of muammar qaddafi, the tripoli government may pursue retaliation against the united states and its western allies through surrogate terrorist groups, particularly herbmk while the deaths of bin laden and saif al-arab are completely unrelated, two separate and very dangerous groups will now be looking for revenge against the u.s. and its allies. (source comment: these knowledgeable sources believe that the loaders of the inc are also worried about the reaction to the death of bin laden among rebel fighters and their supporters in libya and egypt, where the al qa'ida leader was very popular. these inc officials do not want the death of bin laden to affect their relations with the west or their support from nato, the u.s., france, or great britain.) unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2015-04841 doc no. c05739702 date: 05/13/2015 state dept. - produced to house select benghazi comm. subject to agreement on sensitive information & redactions. no foia waiver. state-scb0045073  "

(nyt) washington (new york times) - an independent inquiry into the attack on the united states diplomatic mission in libya that killed four americans on sept. 11 sharply criticizes the state department for a lack of seasoned security personnel and relying on untested local militias to safeguard the compound, congressional and state department officials said tuesday night the investigation into the attacks on the diplomatic mission and c.la. annex that killed ambassador i. christopher stevens and three others also faulted state department officials in washington for ignoring requests from officials at the american embassy in tripoli for more guards and safety upgrades to the diplomatic mission. the panel also blamed the state department for waiting for specific warnings of imminent attacks to act rather than adapting security procedures and protocols to a deteriorating security environment by this spring, benghazi, a hotbed of militant activity in eastern libya, had experienced a string of assassinations and attacks, including one on a british envoy's motorcade. finally, the report also blamed two major state department bureaus  diplomatic security and near eastern affairs  for failing to coordinate and plan adequate security at the mission. the panel also determined that a number of officials had shown poor leadership. in response to the panel's findings, secretary of state hillary rodhana clinton said in a letter to congress that she was acceptiung all 29 of the panel's recommendations, several of which are classified. mrs. clinton is taking specific steps to correct the problems, according to officials. they say the state department is asking permission from congress to transfer $1.3 billion from funds that had been allocated for spending in iraq. this includes $553 million for additional marine security guards; $130 million for diplomatic security personnel; and $691 million for improving security at installations abroad. on monday, an independent panel that was established to investigate the attack presented the report to the state department. the panel, called an accountability review board, is led by thomas r. pickering, a veteran diplomat. it includes four other members, among them mike mullen, the retired admiral who served as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. the board is authorized by a 1986 lavv intended to strengthen security at united states diplomatic missions. the state department sent a lengthy classified version of the report to congress on tuesday. mr. pickering and admiral mullen are scheduled to meet with members of the senate foreign relations committee and house foreign affairs committee in closed session on wednesday. on thursday, william j. burns and thomas r nides, both deputy secretaries of states, will testity to both panels. mrs. clinton, who is stillrecovering from a concussion she suffered last week after fainting while sick from a stomach flu, is at home this week. the head of the house panel, representative ileana ros-lehtinen, a florida republican, however, has made clear that she planned to ask mrs. clinton to testify at a future time unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2015-04841 doc no. c05739846 date: 05/13/2015 state dept. - produced to house select benghazi comm. subject to agreement on sensitive information & redactions. no foia waiver. state-scb0045828 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2015-04841 doc no. c05739846 date: 05/13/2015 state dept. - produced to house select benghazi comm. subject to agreement on sensitive information & redactions. no foia waiver. biewsrickers wert senior department officials ta breaking neela this item appears; es t dfd in its original publication end does not contain enahmis of commentary by department somas. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2015-04841 doc no. c05739846 date: 05/13/2015 state dept. - produced to house select benghazi comm. subject to agreement on sensitive information & redactions. no foia waiver. state-5cb0045829  "

(new poll in guardian shows widespread disaffection with all parties as a result of the commons expenses scandal; 27 percent voting for fringe parties.) gordon will attempt to overwhelm news coverage of the loss with a cabinet reshuffle, as early as the next day, june 5. the plot (sounds like the tudors): david is the target, from multiple angles and motives, personal ambition mixed with anti-blairism. peter has always wanted to be foreign secretary, a job held by his grandfather, herbert morrison. (morrison was also deputy pm, why doesn't peter want that?) new labour people regard peter as more ambitious than new labour at this point. he supported gordon's utterly misbegotten and wildly unpopular proposal to raise the top tax rate to 50 percent. the fallout is less resentment of the affluent to paying more or grudging understanding of need for new revenues as it is a sense that labour under gordon is abandoning the project for social aspiration and opportunity that is at the heart of the new labour message. ed balls, one of gordon's closest longtime advisers, is also determined to topple david. balls is a contemporary of david's, wants to be leader of the party himself, and continues the gordon v. tony bitter rivalry into the future. balls is currently minister for children and schools and was linked to damian mcbride (gordon's hatchetman, who has trashed blairites, got caught out on his blogging scheme to smear cameron). if gordon names peter to david's job, balls would take peter's and become business secretary. david would be pushed into home secretary. once balls takes peter's job, balls will likely reverse peter's privatization proposal for the royal mail to win support from party's left-wing base, beginning of his campaign against david for post-gordon leadership struggle. tony sees the situation as terminal. hope to speak wi th him soon. he is trying to become president of europe if and when lisbon treaty passes. jonathan made an interesting and ironic comment about colin powell, given tony's deference to him, that powell's flaw was being too deferential to bush. from bitter experience, jonathan is wishing you well, be close to the president, and advance your ideas, too. there's more for when we can talk. sid unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05761562 date: 06/30/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05761562 date: 06/30/2015 at last, a great mobile device for under $50. take a peek! <http://pr.atwola.com/promoclk/100122638x1222626752x1201458773/aol?redir=http://www.getpeek.com/aol> unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05761562 date: 06/30/2015  "

follows. shortly before 1000 warsaw time, a polish government tu-154 plane carrying a delegation headed by polish president lech kaczynski crashed in heavy fog at the airport in smolensk, russia. russian officials have told the press that there were no survivors; the foreign ministry spokesman said there were 88 passengers on board. the delegation was en route to ceremonies hosted by the russian government to commemorate the 70t1, anniversary of the katyn massacres. there is as yet not government confirmation of the deaths, but there is no expectation of survivors. speaker of the polish sejm (the lower house of parliament) bronislaw komorowski is en route to warsaw to take over the powers of the presidency and those of the commander in chief, according to press reports. according to the polish constitution, if the president dies in office, the speaker temporarily assumes the presidency, and has 14 days to announce the date of special presidential elections. the elections must be held within 60 days of his announcement. this is the first major test of the polish constitution, and the government is itself sorting out the details of the procedure in this unprecedented circumstance. prime minister tusk is returning from gdansk to warsaw, and will chair a meeting of the council of ministers at 1p local time. tusk has received condolence telephone calls

power-sharing government from 12 april in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that \"opens a new chapter\" after decades of violence, gordon brown said today. standing alongside his irish counterpart, brian cowen, at a press conference at hillsborough castle outside belfast, the prime minister said the \"inspirational\" agreement between sinn fein <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/sinn-fein> and the democratic unionist party (dup) <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/dup> was a foundation for lasting peace. unclassified u.s. department of

<http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-dup-ulster- deal> last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace  comes after two weeks of round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse. it will see policing and justice powers devolved from westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans on overseeing parades. brown, who travelled to belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of \"a new spirit of mutual co-operation and respect\". the deal meets a key sinn fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing executive. in return, the dup has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in northern ireland, including the abolition of the parades commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists. a cross-community vote will now be held in the stormont assembly on 9 march before the policing and justice powers are devolved from london on 12 april. brown told reporters: \"the achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. this moment and this agreement belongs to the people of northern ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... this is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of talks, weeks of stalemate.\" cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making \"fair and balanced compromises\" to bridge the divisions and said the quality of the negotiations meant that the \"devolved institutions can and will work\". the northern ireland secretary, shaun woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. the deal would \"absolutely\" make northern ireland a safer place, he said. the dup leader, peter robinson, said the agreement \"will be more enduring because of the time spent\" in forming it. referring back to the belfast agreement of 1998 <http://www.nio.gov.uk/the-agreement> when negotiations bore fruit at the 11th hour, the sinn fein president, gerry adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as \"yet another very good friday\". jeffrey donaldson told the guardian the dup's 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal. but the ulster unionist party (uup) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up legislation to change the way parades are judged. a uup spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two governments. \"we have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it,\" she said. the talks, which centred on hillsborough castle, outside belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in the near 20-year peace process. sinn fein had accused the dup of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led by the two parties. the agreement finally came near midnight at stormont's parliament building. earlier in the evening sinn fein had said the basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the dup leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it. robinson emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the proposals. earlier in the week up to 14 dup assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give unionists enough concessions. robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal. \"we have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in northern ireland and to the community. \"an essential element of the democratic unionist party's manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we believe this can be the basis for gaining that confidence.\" however the leader of the hardline traditional unionist voice (tuv), jim allister, questioned why the 14 dup rebels had changed their minds. \"the deal hasn't changed, only the snowmen of the dup, who melted once the heat came on,\" allister said. the dup now faces a struggle to ward off the tuv threat in the forthcoming general election. allister will portray the deal as a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05767361 date: 08/31/2015  "

observer, the sunday newspaper of the guardian, on the chilcot inquiry, summarizing the testimony so far and what is expected this week while you are drumming up support for the afghanistan initiative. britain and europe are riveted by chilcot, especially official circles. the objective correlative, of course, is trust in any u.s. administration and deep skepticism about the afghanistan project. yet another undercurrent among the mandarins is disdainful resentment of indifference to britain, a sentiment beyond labour or the tories but what has emerged as the view of the permanent establishment at whitehall and elsewhere. mandelson watch: after miliband declined to reach for the eu foreign secretaryship (though sarkozy wanted him to take it and brown was not averse, even favorable), mandelson personally campaigned on his own for it among the europeans. mandelson was eager to miliband to take the eu post, allowing mandelson to be appointed foreign minister. when miliband refused, mandelson's ambition was thwarted, and tried to seize the eu position for himself, but without any backing in europe or from gordon. the europeans thought him mad. suddenly, they recalled his bad or strange behavior as uk commissioner to the eu. when christine ashton was named, mandelson briefed the press on her lack of credentials, etc. ashton, as it happens, had worked the press to try to help mandelson when he had gotten into the mess that led to his first resignation. those inside the government who remember this see it as an illustration of the principle that no good deed goes unpunished. mandelson, in a snit, is now not speaking to gordon as though his rejection were gordon's fault. one more item: did you read jim hoagland in the washington post today? he nails mcdonough for trashing biden, among other things. enclosed below story on chilcot: http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/nov/29/iraq-war-inquiry-chilcot-blair chilcot inquiry: mandarins take revenge on tony blair over iraq civil servants and diplomats are lining up to stick a knife into former pm's reputation * toby helm <http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tobyhelm> and rajeev syal <http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rajeev-syal> * the observer <http://observerguardian.co.uk> , sunday 29 november 2009 * whitehall mandarins are supreme masters of subtle evasion. but they do not rise to the top of their trade without also knowing how to stick in the knife. at times the chilcot inquiry into britain's involvement in iraq since 2001, which opened last week, resembled a gentlemen's club moved to the sanitised surroundings of the queen elizabeth ii conference centre in westminster. oxbridge-educated pillars of the establishment politely questioned other oxbridge-educated pillars of the establishment about who said what to whom in which memo. the inquiry is a peculiar mixture of the old and the new, the open and closed. it is conducted in the language of whitehall, yet beamed live by webcam to the world. critics are convinced that, for all sir john chilcot's promises to the contrary, it will turn out to be another whitehall whitewash. for the cognoscenti, little new information has yet emerged, and when the final report is written it will not seek to apportion blame. yet beneath the equivocation and mandarin-speak, whitehall seems, in as much as it knows how, to be using chilcot to wield the scalpel. throughout the first week the pent-up frustrations of diplomats and career civil servants over the way tony blair <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/tonyblair> and george bush secretly plotted to oust saddam hussein, bypassing the \"official channels\" in which they operate, has been there for all to see. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05767479 date: 07/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05767479 date: 07/31/2015 chilcot is said to have been warned by his whitehall friends that many witnesses will be ready to unburden themselves - finally to take revenge. in session after session they have appeared to do that. blair's reputation has been sliced like salami day after day. sir william ehrman, the foreign office's former director of international security, volunteered last wednesday that the threat from saddam's supposed weapons of mass destruction was known to be limited. in the gentlest way he drove in the dagger. \"we did, i think on 10 march [2003], get a report that chemical weapons might have remained disassembled and saddam hadn't yet ordered their assembly. there was a suggestion that iraq might lack warheads capable of effective dispersal of agents.\" ever the diplomat, however, ehrman went on to say that the intelligence warnings had not made any difference to the case for war. \"i don't think it invalidated the point about the programmes he had. it was more about use,\" he said. but he had set the tone. on thursday, sir christopher meyer, uk ambassador in washington from 1997 to 2003, who has already criticised the government over iraq in his memoirs, went for blair, mercilessly comparing his qualities as a war leader to those of margaret thatcher. \"i'm not trying to make a party political point here whatsoever, but quite often i think about this: what would margaret thatcher have done?\" meyer asked. \"i think she would have insisted on a coherent political and diplomatic strategy and she would have demanded the greatest clarity about what the heck happened if, and when, you removed saddam hussein.\" a former press secretary to john major who can speak like a mandarin but, equally, can talk like a layman, he said blair had failed miserably to extract a price from george bush for his loyalty. \"we could have achieved more by playing a tougher role... if, for example... tony blair had said: 'i want to help you, george, on this, but i have to say, in all honesty, that i will not be able to take part in any military operation unless we have palpable progress on the [middle east] peace process and we have absolute clarity on what happens in iraq if it comes up.' i think that would have changed the nature -- it would not have led to a rupture  it would have changed the nature of american planning. \" even when defending uk policy, he was on the offensive. asked if policy had been adapted to stay in line with washington's, meyer added: \"i wouldn't say it was as extremely poodle-ish as that.\" on friday, sir jeremy greenstock, britain's former ambassador to the united nations, told chilcot he had threatened to resign in 2002 if at least one security council resolution was not passed. he added: \"i regard our participation in the military action in iraq in march 2003 as legal but of questionable legitimacy, in that it did not have the democratically observable backing of the great majority of [un] member states, or even perhaps of the majority of people inside the uk.\" today new arguments are raging over whether the inquiry will have access to, and publish, the most sensitive documents  including legal advice given to the government by the former attorney general, lord goldsmith, during the lead-up to war. nick clegg, the liberal democrat leader, has written to gordon brown saying that, unless all such material is published, the inquiry will be a sham and the public's sense that it has been denied the facts will remain. but it will still be essential viewing nonetheless. this week will see more key witnesses. the most revealing testimony could come tomorrow when sir david manning, blair's former foreign policy <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/foreignpolicy> adviser, is certain to be asked about his authorship of a memo which purportedly revealed details of a secret meeting between bush and blair in january 2003. according to reports, the five pages of secret documents, known as the manning memo, recorded the white house meeting on 31 january which allegedly shows that bush and blair made a deal to carry out an invasion regardless of whether weapons of mass destruction were discovered by un weapons inspectors. it appears to be in direct contradiction with statements that blair made to parliament afterwards that saddam would be given a final chance to disarm. the memo also disclosed that bush floated the idea of painting a u-2 spyplane in un colours and letting it fly low over iraq to provoke saddam into ordering it to be shot down, providing a pretext for the subsequent invasion by america and britain. manning, educated at oriel college, oxford, and a career diplomat, is fiercely independent. he may choose to say more than blair would like, according to one former colleague. he could also be asked to either confirm or deny meyer's evidence that meyer received \"new instructions\" in early 2005 indicating that it was a \"complete waste of time\" to oppose regime change, so strong was the us determination to go down that road. on tuesday, edward chaplin, the foreign office middle east director at the time of the invasion, and sir peter ricketts, the top official in the foreign office, will appear. ricketts, a former chairman of britain's powerful joint intelligence committee, has already given evidence to the inquiry alleging that officials in london knew even before bush came to office in 2001 that there were \"voices\" in washington calling for saddam to be removed from power. ricketts also told unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05767479 date: 07/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05767479 date: 07/31/2015 the inquiry that, until march 2002, whitehall distanced itself from regime change. only one month later, blair told bush that he would support military action \"to bring about regime change\". according to documents leaked five years ago, ricketts described the us in 2002 as \"scrambling to establish a link between iraq and al-qaida\"  a connection that was \"so far, frankly unconvincing\". on thursday, sir kevin tebbit, the ministry of defence's permanent secretary during the invasion, will be asked to give evidence about the military planning. chilcot will, most likely, want to know when the government first began to amass resources for the war and what, if any, preparations were made for the aftermath of an invasion. tebbit could also be urged to divulge the level of intelligence he received on the likelihood of an attack with chemical or biological weapons. after tebbit, a succession of heavy-hitting military men will give evidence. the former chief of the defence staff, admiral the lord boyce, could be asked whether he believes that the invasion was legal. on friday, lieutenant general sir anthony pigott, former deputy chief of the defence staff, and major general david wilson, senior british military adviser to the us military's central command between 2002 and 2003, will be questioned about military planning for the conflict. the last witness to appear this week will be dominic asquith, britain's ambassador to iraq between 2006 and 2007, who will come armed with knowledge of the view from baghdad. when chilcot has made his way through the officials, he will turn in the new year to former ministers, including jack straw, the former foreign secretary, and blair himself. the panel has said that it will also begin to examine the highly controversial issue of whether the invasion was legal  which may turn out to be the focal point of the whole inquiry  in january. in his final report, which is not expected until late 2010 at the earliest, chilcot has said he will not seek to attribute blame. but after only one week it is already clear where much of whitehall believes that lies. the washington post afghanistan: the speech you'll miss by jim hoagland sunday, november 29, 2009 dec. 1, 2009: my fellow americans, this is not the speech you expected to hear. but my wordsmiths are tied in knots writing an acceptance speech for the only nobel peace prize ever awarded for making speeches. so i am going to tell you how i really feel about afghanistan. which is: steamed. i want to accomplish three goals tonight without naming them. first, to let those know-it-alls, generals petraeus and mcchrystal, know one more thing: this is the last big troop increase you get, so make it work. am not going down the incrementalist road that wrecked lyndon johnson's presidency. this is not july 1965, when westmoreland jumped the shark of escalation in vietnam and then never stopped asking for more troops. for all the trouble he has been, dick holbrooke helped by recalling that history in the shadowboxing that dominated my long war council meetings. joe biden has been good in there, too. he's been willing, though not happy, to be characterized in the media as being ready to bug out now. this helped us push back against mcchrystal's effort to box me in at 40,000 additional u.s. soldiers. denis mcdonough, my strategic communications man, sold biden-as-dove brilliantly. wasn't somebody just saying i should promote denis? maybe it was denis? never mind. that tactic won me room to maneuver toward a more realistic number of, say, 23,000 new combat troops, 5,000 additional trainers and a \"nato surge\" of 5,000 foreign troops. that's my second unspoken goal: to come out of this buildup speech without losing the left of the democratic party -- while being able to refute john mccain's charges that i ignored my own generals. triangulation lives. bush put the generals in the limelight to sell the iraq surge after he lost all credibility, and david petraeus's performance was dazzling. which presents two big problems. petraeus is the only person who could get the republican nomination in 2012 and make a serious run against me. (i get paid to think ahead.) and if the generals box me in, civilian control of the military in this country becomes a mockery. clinton was afraid of the military; bush was deep in hock to it. i've got to get the right balance back. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05767479 date: 07/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05767479 date: 07/31/2015 that's why i need bob gates and jim jones. those who scoffed at my keeping on bush's defense secretary, and then making a retired marine four-star i hardly knew my nsc guy, were not thinking that moments like this would come. i already was. gates has maneuvered flawlessly through my waterboarding-by-leaks on afghanistan. he will sell my final number to the uniforms as the \"floor\" for u.s. troops that petraeus argues we need for three years. but gates knows i will make it a ceiling. we can't afford an open-ended commitment. i put peter orszag, as good a budget overseer as you can find, front and center for the photographers in that last war council. many missed it, but nbc's andrea mitchell got it right away. no wonder she's married to alan greenspan. i will bet that stan mcchrystal never drew up a budget in his life. jones tells me these special operations commanders are used to getting whatever they ask for, especially since september 11th. nobody on the hill will deny them anything. jones is also squeezing the europeans to join the battle and is getting results, even from the germans. what is it jones says? maybe the worst thing of all would be to be perceived to lose in afghanistan and then have the europeans say: well, you never asked for more help at the crucial time. makes sense to me. we have sent nato members the numbers we think they can and should provide, country by country. that new secretary general, anders fogh rasmussen, is pulling out the stops, visiting the capitals to get commitments. \"say it now, pay it later,\" we tell the europeans. they have until mid-2010 to deploy their new units. but i need pledges now so i can get across tonight that this is nato's war, not obama's war. that's unspoken-goal number three. so i have frontloaded the speech with allusions to this being about an exit strategy, without boxing myself in on timing, and am presenting the \"civilian surge\" as being as essential as the troop buildup. that helps set up my oslo speech. and who knows? it may even work out that way. if god blesses us all. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05767479 date: 07/31/2015  "

how could this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction? this question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be but we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. this was an attack by a small and savage group  not the people or government of libya. everywhere chris and his team went in libya, in a country scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. and when the attack came yesterday, libyans stood and fought to defend our post, some were wounded. libyans carried chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other americans to safety. and last night, when i spoke with the president of libya, he strongly condemned the violence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible. the friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty of this attack. a free and stable libya is still in america's interest and security, and we will not turn our back on that nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and brought to justice. we are working closely with the libyan authorities to move swiftly and surely. we are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other american embassies, consulates, and citizens. there will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. there is no higher priority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. we are working to determine the precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. some have sought to justify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our embassy in cairo yesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the internet. america's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. but let me be clear there is no justification for this, none. violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. and as long as there are those who would take innocent life in the name of god, the world will never know a true and lasting peace. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2015-04841 doc no. c05739562 date: 05/13/2015 state dept. - produced to house select benghazi comm. subject to agreement on sensitive information & redactions. no foia waiver. state-scb0045255 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2015-04841 doc no. c05739562 date: 05/13/2015 state dept. - produced to house select benghazi comm. subject to agreement on sensitive information & redactions. no foia waiver. it is especially difficult that this happened on september 11th. it's an anniversary that means a great deal to all americans. every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet finished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world continues. but september 11th means even more than that. it is a day on which we remember thousands of american heroes, the bonds that connect all americans, wherever we are on this earth, and the values that see us through every storm. and now it is a day on which we will remember sean, chris, and their colleagues. may god bless them, and may god bless the thousands of americans working in every corner of the world who make this country the greatest force for peace, prosperity, and progress, and a force that has always stood for human dignity  the greatest force the world has ever known. and may god continue to bless the united states of america. thank you. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2015-04841 doc no. c05739562 date: 05/13/2015 state dept. - produced to house select benghazi comm. subject to agreement on sensitive information & redactions. no foia waiver. state-scb0045256  "

'very optimistic' stevens said while he was close with his son, \"we weren't that familiar with the day-to-day activities' he undertook in libya. on the occasions when his son called home, stevens said, he didn't share many details about his work other than to say that \"he was very optimistic about the results of the election and the new government.\" they last spoke by phone in august and by e-mail days before his son's death. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2015-04841 doc no. c05739703 date: 05/13/2015 state dept. - produced to house select benghazi comm. subject to agreement on sensitive information & redactions. no foia waiver. state-scb0045702 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2015-04841 doc no. c05739703 date: 05/13/2015 state dept. - produced to house select benghazi comm. subject to agreement on sensitive information & redactions. no foia waiver. stevens, a registered democrat, said he isn't politically active. he declined to say how he'll vote in the presidential election. he said his son, who was a career diplomat and had worked for republican and democratic presidents, hadn't expressed concerns to him about security or support from the administration. \"he felt very strongly about secretary clinton,\" stevens said, referring to secretary of state hillary clinton. \"he felt she was an extremely able person.\" as for whether he had the tools and protection he needed for his job, stevens said of his son: \"we didn't get into that\" sort of discussion. \"i never heard him say a critical word about the state department or the administration, or any administration for that matter. he came up through the foreign service, not politics.\" obama call stevens said neither of the two presidential campaigns reached out to him, and that he is grateful for that. he said obama telephoned him after his son's death to express his regrets and talk about identifying the perpetrators who should be brought to justice, and that the conversation was in the context of his presidential duties and not political. while polls indicate that voters say obama would do a better job on foreign policy issues, republicans see an opportunity to cut into that advantage, pointing to surveys showing that voters have grown less satisfied since the sept. 11 assault in libya. stevens stopped short of directly criticizing either candidate. \"i'm not sure exactly what he's been saying and not saying, but our position is it would be a real shame if this were politicized,\" stevens said, referring to romney. \"our concern now is memorializing chris and remembering his contribution to the country.\" campaign shift romney's current foreign policy position marks a shift in tone from a campaign that has focused almost exclusively on economic issues and jobs. the romney team is attempting to link two campaign messages by charging obama with weakening american interests abroad at the same time as he's failed to boost the economy back home. speaking to voters on oct. 12 in richmond, virginia, romney chastised vice president joe biden for his defense of the administration's actions in the libya attack. \"he's doubling down on denial, and we need to understand exactly what happened as opposed to just having people brush this aside,\" romney said. during last week's vice presidential debate, biden said the white house wasn't told of a request for additional security at the mission in benghazi the month before the incident. state department official eric nordstrom, who served as a regional security officer in tripoli until july, told a congressional committee that he was turned down when he requested an extension of a 16-member security support team that was scheduled to leave libya in august.

hillary re: backdrop to your coming week below is a piece published today in the observer, the sunday newspaper of the guardian, on the chilcot inquiry, summarizing the testimony so far and what is expected this week while you are drumming up support for the afghanistan initiative. britain and europe are riveted by chilcot, especially official circles. the objective correlative, of course, is trust in any u.s. administration and deep skepticism about the afghanistan project. yet another undercurrent among the mandarins is disdainful resentment of indifference to britain, a sentiment beyond labour or the tories but what has emerged as the view of the permanent establishment at whitehall and elsewhere. mandelson watch: after miliband declined to reach for the eu foreign secretaryship (though sarkozy wanted him to take it and brown was not averse, even favorable), mandelson personally campaigned on his own for it among the europeans. mandelson was eager to miliband to take the eu post, allowing mandelson to be appointed foreign minister. when miliband refused, mandelson's ambition was thwarted, and tried to seize the eu position for himself, but without any backing in europe or from gordon. the europeans thought him mad. suddenly, they recalled his bad or strange behavior as uk commissioner to the eu. when christine ashton was named, mandelson briefed the press on her lack of credentials, etc. ashton, as it happens, had worked the press to try to help mandelson when he had gotten into the mess that led to his first resignation. those inside the government who remember this see it as an illustration of the principle that no good deed goes unpunished. mandelson, in a snit, is now not speaking to gordon as though his rejection were gordon's fault. one more item: did you read jim hoagland in the washington post today,? he nails mcdonough for trashing biden, among other things. enclosed below story on chilcot: http://www.guardian.co.uk/lik/2009/nov/29/iraq-war-inquiry-chilcot-blair chilcot inquiry: mandarins take revenge on tony blair over iraq civil servants and diplomats are lining up to stick a knife into former pm's reputation * toby helm <http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tobyhelm> and rajeev syal <http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rajeev-syal> * the observer <http://observer.guardian.co.uk> , sunday 29 november 2009 * whitehall mandarins are supreme masters of subtle evasion. but they do not rise to the top of their trade without also knowing how to stick in the knife. at times the chilcot inquiry into britain's involvement in iraq since 2001, which opened last week, resembled a gentlemen's club moved to the sanitised surroundings of the queen elizabeth ii conference centre in westminster. oxbridge-educated pillars of the establishment politely questioned other oxbridge-educated pillars of the establishment about who said what to whom in which memo. the inquiry is a peculiar mixture of the old and the new, the open and closed. it is conducted in the language of whitehall, yet beamed live by webcam to the world. critics are convinced that, for all sir john chilcot's promises to the contrary, it will turn out to be another whitehall whitewash. for the cognoscenti, little new information has yet emerged, and when the final report is written it will not seek to apportion blame. yet beneath the equivocation and mandarin-speak, whitehall seems, in as much as it knows how, to be using chilcot to wield the scalpel. throughout the first week the pent-up frustrations of diplomats and career civil servants over the way tony blair <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/tonyblair> and george bush secretly plotted to oust saddam hussein, bypassing the \"official channels\" in which they operate, has been there for all to see. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05767434 date: 07/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05767434 date: 07/31/2015 chilcot is said to have been warned by his whitehall friends that many witnesses will be ready to unburden themselves - finally to take revenge. in session after session they have appeared to do that. blair's reputation has been sliced like salami day after day. sir william ehrman, the foreign office's former director of international security, volunteered last wednesday that the threat from saddam's supposed weapons of mass destruction was known to be limited. in the gentlest way he drove in the dagger. \"we did, i think on 10 march [2003], get a report that chemical weapons might have remained disassembled and saddam hadn't yet ordered their assembly. there was a suggestion that iraq might lack warheads capable of effective dispersal of agents.\" ever the diplomat, however, ehrman went on to say that the intelligence warnings had not made any difference to the case for war. \"i don't think it invalidated the point about the programmes he had. it was more about use,\" he said. but he had set the tone. on thursday, sir christopher meyer, uk ambassador in washington from 1997 to 2003, who has already criticised the government over iraq in his memoirs, went for blair, mercilessly comparing his qualities as a war leader to those of margaret thatcher. \"i'm not trying to make a party political point here whatsoever, but quite often i think about this: what would margaret thatcher have done?\" meyer asked. \"i think she would have insisted on a coherent political-and diplomatic strategy and she would have demanded the greatest clarity about what the heck happened if, and when, you removed saddam hussein.\" a former press secretary to john major who can speak like a mandarin but, equally, can talk like a layman, he said blair had failed miserably to extract a price from george bush for his loyalty. \"we could have achieved more by playing a tougher role... if, for example... tony blair had said: 'i want to help you, george, on this, but i have to say, in all honesty, that i will not be able to take part in any military operation unless we have palpable progress on the [middle east] peace process and we have absolute clarity on what happens in iraq if it comes up.' i think that would have changed the nature  it would not have led to a rupture  it would have changed the nature of american planning. \" even when defending uk policy, he was on the offensive. asked if policy had been adapted to stay in line with washington's, meyer added: \"i wouldn't say it was as extremely poodle-ish as that.\" on friday, sir jeremy greenstock, britain's former ambassador to the united nations, told chilcot he had threatened to resign in 2002 if at least one security council resolution was not passed. he added: \"i regard our participation in the military action in iraq in march 2003 as legal but of questionable legitimacy, in that it did not have the democratically observable backing of the great majority of [un] member states, or even perhaps of the majority of people inside the uk.\" today new arguments are raging over whether the inquiry will have access to, and publish, the most sensitive documents  including legal advice given to the government by the former attorney general, lord goldsmith, during the lead-up to war. nick clegg, the liberal democrat leader, has written to gordon brown saying that, unless all such material is published, the inquiry will be a sham and the public's sense that it has been denied the facts will remain. but it will still be essential viewing nonetheless. this week will see more key witnesses. the most revealing testimony could come tomorrow when sir david manning, blair's former foreign policy <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/foreignpolicy> adviser, is certain to be asked about his authorship of a memo which purportedly revealed details of a secret meeting between bush and blair in january 2003. according to reports, the five pages of secret documents, known as the manning memo, recorded the white house meeting on 31 january which allegedly shows that bush and blair made a deal to carry out an invasion regardless of whether weapons of mass destruction were discovered by un weapons inspectors. it appears to be in direct contradiction with statements that blair made to parliament afterwards that saddam would be given a final chance to disarm. the memo also disclosed that bush floated the idea of painting a u-2 spyplane in un colours and letting it fly low over iraq to provoke saddam into ordering it to be shot down, providing a pretext for the subsequent invasion by america and britain. manning, educated at oriel college, oxford, and a career diplomat, is fiercely independent. he may choose to say more than blair would like, according to one former colleague. he could also be asked to either confirm or deny meyer's evidence that meyer received \"new instructions\" in early 2005 indicating that it was a \"complete waste of time\" to oppose regime change, so strong was the us determination to go down that road. on tuesday, edward chaplin, the foreign office middle east director at the time of the invasion, and sir peter ricketts, the top official in the foreign office, will appear. ricketts, a former chairman of britain's powerful joint intelligence committee, has already given evidence to the inquiry alleging that officials in london knew even before bush came to office in 2001 that there were \"voices\" in washington calling for saddam to be removed from power. ricketts also told unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05767434 date: 07/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05767434 date: 07/31/2015 the inquiry that, until march 2002, whitehall distanced itself from regime change. only one month later, blair told bush that he would support military action \"to bring about regime change\". according to documents leaked five years ago, ricketts described the us in 2002 as \"scrambling to establish a link between iraq and al-qaida\"  a connection that was \"so far, frankly unconvincing\". on thursday, sir kevin tebbit, the ministry of defence's permanent secretary during the invasion, will be asked to give evidence about the military planning. chilcot will, most likely, want to know when the government first began to amass resources for the war and what, if any, preparations were made for the aftermath of an invasion. tebbit could also be urged to divulge the level of intelligence he received on the likelihood of an attack with chemical or biological weapons. after tebbit, a succession of heavy-hitting military men will give evidence. the former chief of the defence staff, admiral the lord boyce, could be asked whether he believes that the invasion was legal. on friday, lieutenant general sir anthony pigott, former deputy chief of the defence staff, and major general david wilson, senior british military adviser to the us military's central command between 2002 and 2003, will be questioned about military planning for the conflict. the last witness to appear this week will be dominic asquith, britain's ambassador to iraq between 2006 and 2007, who will come armed with knowledge of the view from baghdad. when chilcot has made his way through the officials, he will turn in the new year to former ministers, including jack straw, the former foreign secretary, and blair himself. the panel has said that it will also begin to examine the highly controversial issue of whether the invasion was legal  which may turn out to be the focal point of the whole inquiry  in january. in his final report, which is not expected until late 2010 at the earliest, chilcot has said he will not seek to attribute blame. but after only one week it is already clear where much of whitehall believes that lies. the washington post afghanistan: the speech you'll miss by jim hoagland sunday, november 29, 2009 dec. 1, 2009: my fellow americans, this is not the speech you expected to hear. but my wordsmiths are tied in knots writing an acceptance speech for the only nobel peace prize ever awarded for making speeches. so i am going to tell you how i really feel about afghanistan. which is: steamed. i want to accomplish three goals tonight without naming them. first, to let those know-it-alls, generals petraeus and mcchrystal, know one more thing: this is the last big troop increase you get, so make it work. i am not going down the incrementalist road that wrecked lyndon johnson's presidency. this is not july 1965, when westmoreland jumped the shark of escalation in vietnam and then never stopped asking for more troops. for all the trouble he has been, dick holbrooke helped by recalling that history in the shadowboxing that dominated my long war council meetings. joe biden has been good in there, too. he's been willing, though not happy, to be characterized in the media as being ready to bug out now. this helped us push back against mcchrystal's effort to box me in at 40,000 additional u.s. soldiers. denis mcdonough, my strategic communications man, sold biden-as-dove brilliantly. wasn't somebody just saying should promote denis? maybe it was denis? never mind. that tactic won me room to maneuver toward a more realistic number of, say, 23,000 new combat troops, 5,000 additional trainers and a \"nato surge\" of 5,000 foreign troops. that's my second unspoken goal: to come out of this buildup speech without losing the left of the democratic party -- while being able to refute john mccain's charges that i ignored my own generals. triangulation lives. bush put the generals in the limelight to sell the iraq surge after he lost all credibility, and david petraeus's performance was dazzling. which presents two big problems. petraeus is the only person who could get the republican nomination in 2012 and make a serious run against me. (i get paid to think ahead.) and if the generals box me in, civilian control of the military in this country becomes a mockery. clinton was afraid of the military; bush was deep in hock to it. i've got to get the right balance back. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05767434 date: 07/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05767434 date: 07/31/2015 that's why i need bob gates and jim jones. those who scoffed at my keeping on bush's defense secretary, and then making a retired marine four-star i hardly knew my nsc guy, were not thinking that moments like this would come. i already was. gates has maneuvered flawlessly through my waterboarding-by-leaks on afghanistan. he will sell my final number to the uniforms as the \"floor\" for u.s. troops that petraeus argues we need for three years. but gates knows i will make it a ceiling. we can't afford an open-ended commitment. i put peter orszag, as good a budget overseer as you can find, front and center for the photographers in that last war council. many missed it, but nbc's andrea mitchell got it right away. no wonder she's married to alan greenspan. i will bet that stan mcchrystal never drew up a budget in his life. jones tells me these special operations commanders are used to getting whatever they ask for, especially since september 11th. nobody on the hill will deny them anything. jones is also squeezing the europeans to join the battle and is getting results, even from the germans. what is it jones says? maybe the worst thing of all would be to be perceived to lose in afghanistan and then have the europeans say: well, you never asked for more help at the crucial time. makes sense to me. we have sent nato members the numbers we think they can and should provide, country by country. that new secretary general, anders fogh rasmussen, is pulling out the stops, visiting the capitals to get commitments. \"say it now, pay it later,\" we tell the europeans. they have until mid-2010 to deploy their new units. but i need pledges now so i can get across tonight that this is nato's war, not obarna's war. that's unspoken-goal number three. so i have frontloaded the speech with allusions to this being about an exit strategy, without boxing myself in on timing, and am presenting the \"civilian surge\" as being as essential as the troop buildup. that helps set up my oslo speech. and who knows? it may even work out that way. if god blesses us all. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05767434 date: 07/31/2015  "

(a new pentagon study shows that most u.s. troops and their families don't care if gays are allowed to serve openly.) in an interview with progressive bloggers, the president was asked why he was lagging behind republicans like ted olson on gay marriage. noting that he has a lot of friends and staffers in committed gay relationships, obama conceded only that his attitude was evolving. \"i think it's pretty clear where the trend lines are going,\" the president said. trend lines? really inspiring, dude. one top aide told me that the president  who perversely tried to marginalize a once-captivated press corps  was beginning to realize that he had not used his charm as effectively as he could have. his inner circle believed too much in the power of the aura and in protecting the brand. they didn't think they needed to sell anything or fight back when the crazies started sliming them. they didn't care that the average citizen needed an m.b.a. to understand the financial plan and a ph.d. to fathom what the health care plan would mean. because obama stayed above it all on health care and delegated to max baucus, he missed the moment in august of 2009 when sarah palin and the tea party got oxygen with their loopy rants on death panels. it never occurred to the icon that such wildness and gullibility would trump lofty rationality. as the president tries to ride the tea party tiger, let's hope for this change: that he puts some audacity in his audacity. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05771183 date: 08/31/2015  "

lessons from aceh multi donor trust fund.docx fyi: from one of the folks we hired who had been working with pierre louis: lessons from the aceh and nias multi-donor trust fund 1. the government of indonesia (g01) responded to the tsunami by issuing a series of government decrees, and immediately organized both overview and relief efforts to ensure a rational and coordinated response. the first task was to produce a damage and loss assessment (dla). the dla was followed by a more detailed master plan for rehabilitation and reconstruction (mprr). the mprr provided in-depth sector plans, spatial planning, the governance and supervision arrangements of finances with considerable attention to how to avoid or minimize corruption. the process behind the mprr was consultative, with a wide range of local stakeholders and public offices being heard. the mprr was presented on 26 march, only 3 months after the tsunami. 2. the mprr was to form the basis for a general three-stage strategy. the relief phase was originally set to six months, but was then reduced to three: january- march 2005. the rehabilitation phase is to run for about 21 months, through december 2006, and the reconstruction phase from july 2006 through december 2009. the mprr provides a well defined phasing of interventions. 3. the objectives for the relief efforts were humanitarian relief: rescue; food and medicine; emergency infrastructure and temporary shelter; and burying the dead. the rehabilitation phase is to restore services to minimum level: public services; economic facilities; banking and financial institutions; trauma treatments; secure land rights; law and order; and temporary shelter. finally, reconstruction is to rebuild the region: rebuilding the economy (production, trade and banking); the transportation, telecommunications, and social and cultural systems; improving institutional capacity; and housing. 4. the government set up a ministerial-level agency to manage the mprr program from aceh itself, the rehabilitation and reconstruction agency for aceh and nias. the brr was formally established end april 2005 and became operational early may. the world bank board on 30 march 2005 formally established the multi-donor trust fund (mdf) with a steering committee comprised of brr, goi, donors and civil society. having a credible local coordinators was key to success. 5. the ec channels nearly 93% of its funds through the mdf, while only 2.5% of usd 400 million from the us goes to the mdf. while payments into the fund were slow, disbursements out of it were to begin with even slower. by october 2005, project agreements for about usd 200 million had been signed, but only usd 3 million had actually been disbursed. disbursements picked up the pace thereafter. the delay was caused by two principal impediments: first, donors were quick to pledge funds, but getting all the unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05769391 date: 08/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05769391 date: 08/31/2015 exact written agreements in place took time. this points to the need for donors to be flexible regarding formal agreements, and accept simple, generic paragraphs that can contribute to speedy resolution of slightly differing phrasings and concerns. second, the processing time for project approval and implementation was a concern. since the mdf was to have funded projects on-budget, they had to be implemented by government institutions. this crated bottlenecks. 6. smaller donors joined because they wished to support the reconstruction efforts in aceh but do not have own capacity and often not strong views on how best to pursue this. they want the bank to assume fiduciary responsibilities for the funds in a high-risk environment, and also to take a lead in ensuring that the funds go to prioritized activities. the mdf is thus seen a well-managed bank account with some paid- for administrative services. however, the all-inclusive steering committee made membership large and to some extent unwieldy, and forced it to discuss both policy and operational issues. 7. the multi donor fund secretariat has developed an outreach strategy that includes regular radio talk shows, field visits to meet and discuss with beneficiaries and communication through advertisements as well as a telephone hotline. 8. mdf received praise for engaging the government of indonesia (g01) in policy dialogue. the mdf is thus an entry point for engaging on conditions for sustainability, relevance and impact. 9. because the mdf does not accept strict ear marking of donor contributions  though it does allow for preference indications  it means that the funds are freely available for programming according to the criteria and priorities that the mdf agrees to. given strong goi participation, the mdf is seen as the most successful instrument for harmonization and coordination in an environment that has been criticized for a lack of coordination. the mdf's mid term review conducted in 2008-2009 found that the mdf had made a positive contribution to harmonizing donor efforts and to increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the reconstruction effort. 10. the mdf did not sufficiently engage the private sector and did not have a coherent job creation strategy. the mdf lacked executive rights, but goi and brr are credited with leveraging a decisive response. sent: saturday, january 23, 2010 8:16 am subject: aceh background jim see below. meghann unclassified u.s.

especially if higher profile, can cause sensitivities. best wishes jean-louis lessons from the aceh and nias multi-donor trust fund 11. the government of indonesia (g01) responded to the tsunami by issuing a series of government decrees, and immediately organized both overview and relief efforts to ensure a rational and coordinated response. the first task was to produce a damage and loss assessment (dla). the dla was followed by a more detailed master plan for rehabilitation and reconstruction (mprr). the mprr provided in-depth sector plans, spatial planning, the governance and supervision .arrangements of finances with considerable attention to how to avoid or minimize corruption. the process behind the mprr was consultative, with a wide range of local stakeholders and public offices being heard. the mprr was presented on 26 march, only 3 months after the tsunami. 12. the mprr was to form the basis for a general three-stage strategy. the relief phase was originally set to six months, but was then reduced to three: january- march 2005. the rehabilitation phase is to run for about 21 months, through december 2006, and the reconstruction phase from july 2006 through december 2009. the mprr provides a well defined phasing of interventions. 13. the objectives for the relief efforts were humanitarian relief: rescue; food and medicine; emergency infrastructure and temporary shelter; and burying the dead. the rehabilitation phase is to restore services to minimum level: public services; economic facilities; banking and financial institutions; trauma treatments; secure land rights; law and order; and temporary shelter. finally, reconstruction is to rebuild unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05769391 date:

telecommunications, and social and cultural systems; improving institutional capacity; and housing. 14. the government set up a ministerial-level agency to manage the mprr program from aceh itself, the rehabilitation and reconstruction agency for aceh and nias. the brr was formally established end april 2005 and became operational early may. the world bank board on 30 march 2005 formally established the multi-donor trust fund (mdf) with a steering committee comprised of brr, goi, donors and civil society. having a credible local coordinators was key to success. 15. the ec channels nearly 93% of its funds through the mdf, while only 2.5% of usd 400 million from the us goes to the mdf. while payments into the fund were slow, disbursements out of it were to begin with even slower. by october 2005, project agreements for about usd 200 million had been signed, but only usd 3 million had actually been disbursed. disbursements picked up the pace thereafter. the delay was caused by two principal impediments: first, donors were quick to pledge funds, but getting all the exact written agreements in place took time. this points to the need for donors to be flexible regarding formal agreements, and accept simple, generic paragraphs that can contribute to speedy resolution of slightly differing phrasings and concerns. second, the processing time for project approval and implementation was a concern. since the mdf was to have funded projects on-budget, they had to be implemented by government institutions. this crated bottlenecks. 16. smaller donors joined because they wished to support the reconstruction efforts in aceh but do not have own capacity and often not strong views on how best to pursue this. they want the bank to assume fiduciary responsibilities for the funds in a high-risk environment, and also to take a lead in ensuring that the funds go to prioritized activities. the mdf is thus seen a well-managed bank account with some paid- for administrative services. however, the all-inclusive steering committee made membership large and to some extent unwieldy, and forced it to discuss both policy and operational issues. 17. the multi donor fund secretariat has developed an outreach strategy that includes regular radio talk shows, field visits to meet and discuss with beneficiaries and communication through advertisements as well as a telephone hotline. 18. mdf received praise for engaging the government of indonesia (g01) in policy dialogue. the mdf is thus an entry point for engaging on conditions for sustainability, relevance and impact. 19. because the mdf does not accept strict ear marking of donor contributions  though it does allow for preference indications  it means that the funds are freely available for programming according to the criteria and priorities that the mdf agrees to. given strong go1 participation, the mdf is seen as the most successful instrument for harmonization and coordination in an environment that has been criticized for a lack of coordination. the mdf's mid term review conducted in 2008-2009 found that the mdf had made a positive contribution to harmonizing donor efforts and to increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the reconstruction effort. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05769391 date: 08/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department

the answer, of course, is no, because this is riot about geography. two veteran intelligence operatives with much middle eastern and afghan experience, speaking not for attribution, agreed a stable, secure afghanistan doesn't change the equation, at least not significantly. the popular perception of al-qaida in afghanistan is the same propaganda news clip, shown a gazillion times over the last eight years, replete with terrorist \"trainees\" in shalwar-kameez (knee-length shirts over baggy pantaloons) running through obstacle courses and emerging from tunnels, presumably to kill us all in our beds. al-qaida doesn't need commando-steeled volunteers to attack the united states and its allies. for the next sept. 11, the chances are they have already selected highly motivated, brainwashed wackjobs among the graduates of pakistan's madrassas, who look forward to a one button push to the land of plenty in the sky where 72 impatient maidens await their arrival. al-qaida's \"martyrs\" don't need afghan training camps for wmd terrorism. in fact, to be inconspicuous, they should not have the physique of an avoid-at-all-cost likely to arouse suspicion. al-qaida does not need afghanistan for its next terrorist objective. in fact, those who follow events in afghanistan closely were taken aback when obama said afghanistan was a war of necessity because that's where al-qaida. is. they haven't been there since afghanistan was liberated in october 2001. they moved to pakistan's tribal areas where they attracted volunteers from the middle east and europe. when a reconstituted taliban insurgent force re-entered afghanistan in large numbers in 2004, al-qaida was not interested in its now insecure old training camps. even if pakistan's current offensive.against the taliban and al-qaida in the tribal areas is successful, al-qaida is not an entity that can be captured or destroyed. its clandestine operatives are widely scattered in the middle east, africa, europe, north and south america. as alternatives to afghanistan and pakistan, yemen, in the vernacular of the intelligence community, will do/is doing it. somalia will do/is doing it. west african states whose writ doesn't extend much beyond their capitals will do/are doing it. grimy north african suburbs of major french cities will do/are doing it. british provincial towns with pakistani enclaves will do/are doing it. and the internet's thousands of pro-al-qaida web sites will do/are doing it. osama bin laden and his deputy ayman al-zawahiri are believed to be comfortably installed in a tribal chiefs compound somewhere near quetta, the capital of pakistan's constantly rebellious baluchistan province, which unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05765160 date: 07/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05765160 date: 07/31/2015 has 48 percent of the country's land with. only 10 million of its 175 million people. there is no al-qaida central issuing orders to thousands of adherents the world over. if the:re is no connection between afghanistan and the core problem of \"no more sept. lls,\" what are the united states and 41 friendly nations doing there? even in the event of a taliban victory in the years to come, the taliban would not be stupid enough to invite al-qaida back. three months prior to sept. 11, 2001, there was palpable tension between taliban leader mullah omar and bin laden. omar complained that bin laden was issuing \"too many fatwas (religious edicts) which he has no business doing as he didn't complete his religious education.\" omar also prevented journalists from seeing bin laden. the taliban leader knows he lost power and his country because of what bin laden and his terrorists did to the united states. in today's afghanistan almost everything turns out to be corruption and mismanagement. the average citizen has seen little benefit from expenditures in the $250 billion range -- on top of $1 trillion in iraq. the .u.s. effort has been plagued by fraud, laced with mismanagement and bereft of strategic focus. one example among many others came in 2007 when the united states awarded a massive contract worth some $300 million to a:ey, a florida-based company, to supply the afghan army with 52 types of ammo, chiefly bullets for ak-47s. all requirements for safety inspections, mandatory for all ammo delivered to u.s. forces, were removed. thus aey was able to shop around in eastern europe for the cheapest ammo available. millions of rounds of old chinese ammo made in the 1960s turned out to be substandard. and dangerous. the state department was aware of what was going on but did not object as speed was the only criterion. aey and its officers were eventually indicted in florida. but u.s. officials involved got off with a slap on the wrist. wherever u.s. inspectors look, they find fraud and abuse. there are even cases -- reported by globalpost reporter jean mackenzie -- of american contractors paying bribes to the taliban to ensure aid projects are not disrupted. this is a recipe for a war without end. she also reports a disguised taliban office in kabul that reviews all aid projects and determines the amount to be paid to the taliban. if true, the united states is paying the afghan government to fight the taliban while also paying the taliban to fight the afghan government. the key lies in pakistan. almost all terrorist trails in europe lead back to pakistan -- and its madrassas. these are the free koranic schools that have stepped into the vacuum of no education system for the poor as the military takes up 50 percent of government revenue. a fraction of what the united states has spent in iraq and afghanistan would go a long way to turning pakistan around. instead, congress, in its infinite wisdom, after authorizing $1.2 trillion in both wars allocated $7.5 billion to pakistan over five years -- with umpteen caveats. in a country of 175 million, a drop in the proverbial bucket. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05765160 date: 07/31/2015  "

there would be other individuals who heard it, or bits and pieces of it, or various levels of it.\" suppressed evidence there were five other individuals, including now mcewen, who had first-hand knowledge of thomas's behavior as hill described it, but none testified in the hearing. nyt: ms. mcewen has generally kept a low profile all these years, largely, she explains, out of respect for the wishes of justice thomas, who asked her to \"take the same position toward him as his first wife had take\" and not speak publicly about their relationship. a former prosecutor and judge, she is now retired. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05775405 date: 08/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05775405 date: 08/31/2015 wp: mcewen recalls writing thomas a short note before the confirmation hearings, curious about what she should say if she were quizzed about their relationship. she said thomas preferred that she would take the same attitude of his first wife\" who never talked publicly about their relationship. wp: angela wright, who in 1984 worked as a public affairs director at the equal opportunity employment commission  which polices sexual harassment claims  during thomas's long tenure as chairman, shared similar accounts with senate investigators. once when walking into an eeoc seminar with thomas, he asked her \"what size are your breasts?\" according to the transcript of her senate interview. wp: her (wright's) story was corroborated by a former eeoc speechwriter, rose jourdain, who told senate investigators that wright had become increasingly uneasy around thomas because of his comments about her appearance. wp: another woman, sukari hardnett, who worked as a special assistant to thomas in 1985 and 1986, wrote in a letter to the judiciary committee: \"if you were young, black, female and reasonably attractive, you knew full well you were being inspected and auditioned as a female\" by thomas. neither wright, nor rose jourdain (her corroborator), nor sukari hardnett testified at the hearing. as he drew the hearing to a close, biden lifted a subpoena for wright to testify and instead transcripts of the interviews with wright and her corroborator were simply entered into the record then the hearing was concluded, and thomas was confirmed the next day. dowd: \"for the written record biden allowed negative accounts only from women who had worked for thomas. he also ruled out testimony from women who simply had personal relationships with thomas, and he did not respond to a note from mcewen  as a former us attorney who had once worked as a counsel for biden's committee  reminding him of her long relationship with thomas.\" intimidating a witness a fourth woman with knowledge of thomas's behavior, kaye savage, was first named in a 1994 book strange justice by jill abramson and jane mayer. savage was a close colleague of thomas's and hill's in the reagan administration. savage was interviewed by judiciary committee staff after she contacted the committee, and a staffer made notes, but she was never called to testify. her story did not become public until abramson and mayer obtained the staff notes and interviewed savage, who told the authors of visiting thomas's apartment during the time hill was working for thomas and observing stacks of pornographic magazines and all of the walls of the apartment papered with centerfolds of large- breasted nude women. from blinded by the right: \"the biggest problem raised by the strange justice authors for the thomas camp was the testimony of yet another woman, kaye savage, who had not been heard from during the first round of hearings.\" \"i called mark paoletta (a close thomas friend and former associate white house counsel under bush) at his washington law office and discussed the savage matter with him. mark had been helping me on all other aspects of (my) review (of strange justice for the american spectator) and we developed a plan for dealing with savage. i needed to find out quickly who she was and what negative information might exist about her before confronting her and trying to force her into backing off the story she had told the strange justice authors. i was intent on doing to savage what had been done to anita hill and angela wright during the thomas hearings. mark said he would call clarence thomas (then a sitting justice) and see what he could find out.\" \"within an hour or so that morning mark phoned me back. he said he had posed my question about how to discredit savage to thomas, who knew i was at work on a review of the mayer and abramson book. (personal note: i had personally told thomas this when i met him at a paoletta family event only days prior). mark told me that thomas had, in fact, some derogatory information on his former friend savage; he passed it along to mark so that mark could give it to me. quoting thomas directly, mark told me of unverified embarrassing personal information about savage that thomas claimed had been raised against her in a sealed court record of a divorce and child custody battle more than a decade ago. thomas also told mark where savage worked after mark related that i was eager to hunt her down as soon as possible. surely skirting the bounds of judicial propriety to intimidate and smear yet another witness against him, thomas was playing dirty and so was i.\" after an excerpt of blinded featuring the savage story was published in talk magazine in 2001, the nyt reported (6-27- 01): \"reached at home in washington last night, ms. savage said that mr. brock had tried to intimidate her but that he unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05775405 date: 08/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05775405 date: 08/31/2015 had not told her the source of the negative information.

'and anita's my friend.\" (personal note: though i confronted savage with the information in an effort to get her to recant, she never did, although i made it appear otherwise by journalistic sleight-of-hand involving a written statement savage had given me under duress about her interviews with mayer and abramson in my spectator review). frank rich, nyt (12-29-94): \"this time mr. brock's partisan desperation has led him to a tactic that is beyond the pale of even tabloid journalism and that would make any citizen think twice before speaking freely to any journalist: he tried to bully a source in strange justice, a one-time hill and thomas associate named kaye savage, to get her to sign a statement denying her own contribution to the book.\" jamin raskin, a law professor and associate dean at american university in washington, received a call seeking advice from ms. savage after her encounter with mr. brock a few weeks ago: \"she was distraught and said brock was threatening to reveal damaging information about her from a divorce situation unless she agreed to retract everything she had said to the authors of strange justice, he said in an interview. 'i told her this is a clear violation of journalistic ethics and might be blackmail and that she shouldn't give in to it. she was beside herself because she had told the truth.\" more confirmation on pornography blinded by the right: \"i next set out to blow away the mayer and abramson story that thomas had been a frequent customer of an x-rated video store near dupont circle, called graffiti, where in the early 1980s he was alleged to have rented x-rated videos of the type that hill claimed he had discussed with her in graphic terms. in the hearings thomas had pointedly refused to answer questions about his personal use of pornography, other than to categorically deny that he had ever talked about porn with hill (or with anyone in the workplace). the graffiti story was another theretofore unknown piece of evidence for hill's case...\" \"now that mark had opened up a channel directly to thomas, i asked him to find out for me whether thomas had owned the video equipment needed to view movies at home in the early 1980s...mark came back with a straightforward answer: thomas not only had the video equipment in his apartment, but he also habitually rented pornographic movies from graffiti during the years anita hill worked for him. here was the proof that senate investigators and reporters had been searching for during the hearings. nyt: (lillian mcewen) said he kept a stack of pornographic magazines, \"frequented a store on dupont circle that catered to his needs.\" calls for investigation partial transcript of cnn's crossfire, 6-28-2001, after talk published the excerpt from blinded on kaye savage: eleanor smeal, president of feminist majority foundation: \"i think there should be a hearing. not only do i think there should be a hearing, i think that we can get to the bottom of it. there's other people now involved. there's kaye savage, who was, in fact, discredited by brock. there are other authors who have written and were discredited by brock. there is  essentially what brock is saying they're very serious charges, they're not light charges. they are charges that he was fed information, and being fed this information, they discredited people wrongfully and knowingly. and this is serious. \"and let's face it, the supreme court these are life-time appointments. we are sitting here with a supreme court that elected this president by a five to four decision, but a supreme court that could reverse roe v wade and many many serious things affecting women... \"let's get right to  let's just get right to this, the problem with clarence thomas. there was a book that came out by two reputable reporters, jill abramson and jane mayer. and it collaborated  it confirmed a lot of what anita hill said. and we now know  of course we don't know this  it's alleged by brock that he knew when he attacked that book and attacked it systematically that he was saying a lie. and so basically that is a reputable account that substantiates what she said... \"why don't you just bring it before a senate judiciary committee and have paoletta there, and not only that, why don't you investigate? i mean in fact there were  it's not just one person's word against another. he said that he was a regular participator in buying videos from a certain store. i mean why can't...\" unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05775405 date: 08/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05775405 date: 08/31/2015 robert novak: \"who said that? who said that?\" smeal: \"paoletta. paoletta said it to brock but what i'm saying is you can check it. i mean you don't have to...\" novak: \"he (paoletta) denies it.\" smeal: 'but that's a person's word. is there no such thing as investigations? is there no such thing as a hearing? i mean and why can't it be bipartisan? if in fact it's true that this man is just a liar, then you clear the name. but if it isn't we get at something also very serious. so  it's a serious allegation.\" unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05775405 date: 08/31/2015  "

opinions are split on whether secretary of state has skills necessary for negotiations by jake tapper washington, sept. 2, 2010  secretary of state hillary clinton today stepped into the international spotlight, assuming the day-to-day responsibility of trying to broker a mideast peace that has eluded her predecessors for decades. seated between israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and palestinian president mahmoud abbas at the state department, clinton heralded the first direct negotiations between the parties in nearly two years. whether both sides can overcome a history of failed negotiations and dashed hopes will depend in large part on the individual leaders making difficult concessions, clinton said. \"we cannot and will not impose a solution. only you can make the decisions necessary to reach an agreement and secure a peaceful future for the israeli and palestinian people,\" she said. clinton appeared to embrace the opportunity and the symbolism of the moment 0 speaking slowly and authoritatively, embracing her partners on both sides, and reminding the world of the difficulties to be expected on the road ahead. \"those who oppose the cause of peace will try in every way possible to sabotage this process, as we have already seen this week,\" she said, referring to the killing tuesday of four israeli civilians by hamas. but \"the core issues at the center of these negotiations -- territory, security, jerusalem, refugees, settlements and others -- will get no easier if we wait, nor will they resolve themselves.\" unclassified u.s. department of state

abdullah ii and egyptian president hosni mubarak, represent a formidable challenge for clinton, who has spent months coaxing both sides back to the negotiating table. they also raise the stakes for president obama, who has set a goal of creating a two-state solution. he met with netanyahu and abbas in private sessions at the white house wednesday and said he was \"cautiously hopeful\" a deal could be reached one year from now. but experts say success in the months ahead will also depend on clinton's skill as a diplomat and mediator. \"i think she has credibility. now whether that translates into diplomatic skills, i don't know,\" said shibley telhami, the anwar sadat professor for peace and development at the university of maryland. \"frankly, she's untested as a mediator.\" other observers see clinton's experience as a politician as an asset because she will be able to not only discuss the policies but understand the politics of how palestinian and israeli leaders \"sell\" the negotiations to their peoples at home. in an abc news exclusive interview, former british prime minister tony blair said clinton has the best type of political mind. \"[it] knows where you meet the point of principle and knows where you need the subtlety and the compromise,\" he said. 1979 camp david accords: the gold standard ahead of the talks, clinton had requested historical background materials concerning past efforts at peace in the region, the ultimately unsuccessful one led by her husband, a source close to the secretary of state said. \"she has this relationship with this fellow who has spent some time talking to leaders -- you know president clinton -- and she has benefitted from his direct experience,\" said state department spokesman p.j. crowley. clinton regards president jimmy carter's 1979 camp david accords brokered between israel and egypt as the gold standard for negotiations, the clinton source said. when then-israeli prime minister menachem begin refused to authorize the dismantling of any israeli settlements, carter's team suggested having the israeli parliament make the decision -- and it did. carter has credited thinking outside of the box and being innovative as the key. \"you have to be innovative and get a lot of outside help to find some alternative route that might bring you to the same goals,\" carter told interviewer don richardson in \"conversations with carter.\" \"you really need to look at life or the negotiation as if it were a chessboard. anticipating what the next move is and what the next move is after that,\" said aaron david miller, an adviser on the region to six secretaries of state. former secretary of state henry kissinger, who negotiated an end to the 1973 arab-israeli war, said that audaciousness was part of testing the limits. \"the art of statesmanship is to find a position between stagnation and overextension, hopefully at the outer limit of what is possible,\" he said during a june 2008

mideast peace talks -- where his \"strategy for success had now boiled down to endurance; i was determined to be the last man standing.\" what the negotiators are doing when they're not negotiating might also play a role, carter has said. by holding peace talks at camp david, \"it was a harmonious environment because egyptians and israelis who had been devoting their adult life to killing each other were required to swim in the same swimming pool, watch the same movies, play on the same tennis courts, throw horseshoes together, sit on the same rock and talks. that was all part of it.\" abc

and segue from past to future. what i have not done here but might be added are references to angela merkel (a courageous woman from the east who embodies the highest values of the west); and specific policies. those can be fitted in. so, some ideas and language: twenty years ago the wall fell. here, in berlin, the moment when tens of thousands of citizens tore it down with hammers and picks and bare hands is called \"die wende,\" a phrase that means more than simply a change but a turning point in history. it was not only a turning point for germany and europe but also for the united states because the wallthe reason for its construction and the reason for its destructionis central to our common historyand to our common future. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05765211 date: 07/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05765211 date: 07/31/2015 richard von weizsaecker said, \"as long as the brandenburg gate is closed, the german question will remain open.\" today i can say with finality, the german question is closed, because the brandenburg gate is wide open! the gate is open, europe is open, and our future together is open. in the forty years from the berlin airlift to the fall of the berlin wall, the atlantic partnership proved itself the most successful alliance for freedom in history. that alliance was, is and shall be the crowning achievement of american foreign policy. and the german  american relationship has always served as its foundation. our alliance represents the reconciliation of former enemies, an inspiration to other peoples and continents devastated by war and hatred, and it must never be taken for granted. in the twenty years since the fall of the wall we have created architecture for an enduring peace. instead of a wall we have built a gateway to the future. president kennedy said in 1963 that in the future free men everywhere will say, \"ich bin ein berliner.\" today berlin has gained a new and even more powerful meaning. forever into the future, the opening of this gate will be the symbol of the return of the dream of freedom, not only to berlin and germany, but to the entire world. the gate, we must remember, was not built as a symbol of freedom. and each of the tyrannies that used the gate as a symbol believed it represented their eternal power. the gate was first erected as a symbol against the french revolution; then it became a symbol of the imperial ambitions of napoleon who marched his army through. it was a symbol of prussian militarism and monarchy. it was seized by the nazi party as the symbol of its 1000 year rule. and then it became a symbol of the communist totalitarianism that built a wall to separate the people of berlin as though freedom could be contained in only one part of the city. here, in berlin, the cold war was coldest. we celebrate the fact that the wall that marred this proud city was taken down by the world's most enthusiastic wrecking crew. the united states always believed in the freedom of berlin because we believed in the future of freedom. the courageous citizens of east germany, poland and other nations of the communist bloc demonstrated their dedication to free and peaceful solution of conflicts through their stand against dictatorship. america stood resolutely as an ally at every moment of this struggle and moved swiftly to help the peoples of europe reunite after 1989. we celebrate the steadiness of purpose, the restraint and respect for ultimate goals that allowed the cold war to end in peace. for how the victory was won was essential to the triumph. 1989 was special. it was that rarest of historical events: a revolution that did not descend into violence. as a result the gate survives not as a cautionary monument to history's darkest moments but to its brightest. today we celebrate the revolution of 1989, the turning point that transformed the brandenburg gate into the symbol of the hope of democracy and the promise of freedom. berliner luft, the air of berlin, has always been unique. i can feel and smell the spirit of freedom in your streets. the great american poet carl sandburg called berlin the chicago of europe. chicago is where i was born and raised. i can sense the same energy, openness and dedication to hard work in both great cities. another chicagoan, president barack obama, was drawn to berlin last july, a city that he said made him feel like a citizen of the world and a citizen of the future. i was very proud to visit our new embassy at the brandenburg gate, located exactly where the wall used to run. our presence here will forever underscore our determination that the spark of freedom from this city in 1989 will help light the torches of freedom throughout the world. the revolution of 1989 did not mark the end of history. having made history together, we are summoned to secure freedom for future generations. as vital at the beginning of the 21' century as it was in the last half of the 20th, the western alliance is called to new tasks. the dreams of 1989 reached farand have farther to reach. old hatreds and conflictsin the balkins, the caucauses, in the middle east, east asia, and africastill unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05765211 date: 07/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05765211 date: 07/31/2015 simmer. we have much to demonstrate what we have learned from the last century. without freedom, without the rule of law, without the opportunity for people to support themselves and their families  without basic human rights-- anger, aggression and violence will prevail. today we are faced with difficult and often dangerous conflicts arising not from conflicts between nations but within them, conflicts exploited by zealots who make the false claim that violence will purify the world and open the gates of heaven. once zealots tried to use this gate to symbolize that message. but through the courage and determination of the people of berlin and their stalwart allies, this gate now stands for a true revolution of the spirit. the long twilight struggle to tear down this wall to make europe whole and free inspires us, in this new century, to help other peoples gain the same measure of security, respect and progress. we need berlin more than ever today. we need your courage, your fortitude, your commitment to the rights of menand womenwe need your example. we are hardly at the end of the history of the west. standing here, where a wall once stood but is no more, in the light from the gate, we have learned from history's deepest lessons. our alliance, linked by shared struggle, dedicated to the ideals of freedom and democracy, strong from the world we have built, now faces a new world of challenges. and we are ready to meet and conquer them. we know it has been done before. we are free menand womenand proud to say, we are all berliners. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05765211 date: 07/31/2015  "

to someone who has watched and studied the iranian revolution of 1979 with fascination, developments in iran today have an eerie reminiscence. then there were massive protests that filled the streets, often marching in dignified but ominous silence; there was bloodshed as nervous security men with guns faced determined but unarmed crowds; there were sullen mourning parades;20there were catchy chants and ritual calls of \"down with the shah!\"; at night the rooftops rang with shouts of allahu akbar. you need only change \"shah\" to \"dictator,\" and you have a description of what is happening in iran today. but there is one very big difference. thirty years ago, iran had a charismatic cleric named ayatollah khomeini who had a refined sense of strategy and a willingness to risk everything for the cause he represented. on the other side was mohammed reza shah, who had been on the throne for some 37 years and who commanded one of the most powerful military and security regimes in the world. on the surface it appeared to be an uneven battle  guns against turbans  but the ruler with the guns wavered and the turbans grew in size and confidence until the old order collapsed. today the nominal leader of the opposition forces is a reformed radical, mir hossein mousavi, who is notably lacking in personal charisma. on the other side is the constitutional leader, ayatollah ichamene' i, who is widely perceived as a cautious political animal with limited qualifications for his religious post and who compensates for his own lack of charisma by manipulation of the political system and the institutions most loyal to him  particularly the politically minded clergy and the powerful security forces, including the revolutionary guards. neither of these men seems to be fully in control of their own forces, let alone the situation. the fraudulent election defeat of mousavi was a triggering event, but the energy behind these unprecedented demonstrations is due more to the sense of outrage and betrayal at the gross manipulation of numbers by the regime than it is about any undying devotion to mousavi. yesterday mousavi ordered that people stay home in face of a conflicting pro-regime demonstration. they marched anyway (and the daughter of former president rafsanjani joined them and urged them on). mousavi then \"ordered\" everyone to march the following day (which they were probably going to do with or without his orders). ichamene'i announced the \"divine assessment\" of the election outcome  even before it would probably have been physically possible to count the more than 40 million ballots. then, in the face of mass protests, he ordered an investigation of the results by the guardian council the same organization that was responsible for managing the election in the first place. no one believed him in either case, and no one expected anything of importance from the guardian council. khamene'i has ordered peace and reconciliation. no one paid any attention. i deliberately did not mention president-elect ahmadinejad. after celebrating his \"victory,\" he went off to a largely symbolic meeting in moscow. he seems to be out of the decision loop and more of a passive player than a major actor in these events. so who is calling the shots? mousavi seems to be running along after the crowd, not leading it. but that is probably all that is required to keep the protest in motion. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05762421 date: 06/30/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05762421 date: 06/30/2015 on the other side, the very little evidence we have suggests that the important decisions are being made by the ultra-conservative leadership of the revolutionary guards, whose political role has ballooned over the past decade, perhaps in cooperation with their extremist counterparts in the clergy. they are utterly ruthless and ideologically fueled. new york times columnist nick kristoff reminded us several days ago (see blog item on june 15 below) at the end of the day, as i saw at tiananmen 20 years ago, when might and right do battle, it's often prudent to bet on might, at least in the short run. the regime seems to have miscalculated badly. they seemed to believe that a sudden coup  the announcement of dramatic election results followed by a show of force  would intimidate and silence the opposition and consolidate their control. that is perhaps more understandable if the decisions were being made by military leaders who tend to see the battle in manichaean terms, rather than politicians such as ichamene'i who are accustomed to seeing shades of gray. in any event, it b ackfired and they now have a much larger crisis on their hands than if they had simply arranged for ahmadinejad to win by a slim margin (which was at least believable). all parties are now in uncharted territory. a significant portion of the iranian population seems to have concluded that their social contract with the rulers  accepting islamic rule in return for a respectful regard for the opinion of the governed, an islamic republic  is no longer valid. they do not trust their rulers. the rulers, whose support has been declining for years in the face of their own inept management of the country, are increasingly replacing popular support with repression. this election seems to have called that tactic into question. for the military, the obvious answer is more repression. so it would appear to be a moment to bet on might. but nobody is fully in command of events. decisions taken in the next weeks will be fateful and could determine the future path of the iranian revolution. there is another lesson as iran's leaders contemplate a tiananmen moment. when the tiananmen crackdown occurred almost exactly ten years ago, one of the leaders of china at the time was zhao ziyang, general secretary of the communist party. he was later fired and placed under house arrest. his smuggled memoirs have just appeared, revealing the depth of disagreements within the lea dership about how to proceed. is it possible that ten years from now we will have a volume describing the intense debates that one can only presume are underway today in the highest councils of the islamic republic of iran?

prague conference fyi sent: sunday, june 21, 2009 10:10 pm subject: fw: your june 22, 2009 article on the prague conference dear  and susan, below is a response from the american gathering of holocaust survivors, the largest and most well-known holocaust survivor group in the united states, strongly opposing a letter to secretary of state clinton, which was simultaneously sent to haaretz in israel, from a group of survivors based in south florida, asking that i be replaced as head of the u.s. delegation because of my association with the jewish claims conference. i will separately send their initial letter. i have talked with ambassador christian kennedy about this scurrilous and unrepresentative attack, made just before the prague conference is to begin. we agree it emanates from two related causes. first, it was instigated by sam dubbin, a class action lawyer in miami who has spent the better part of ten years trying to get congress to overturn the agreements i negotiated on behalf of the clinton administration, which obtained over $8 billion for holocaust survivors and other victims of nazi persecution around the world. he wants to be free to sue the very companies who paid these sums, in return for getting assurances of the u.s. government would do all it could to provide \"legal peace\" from future suits. several federal courts have upheld our agreements. he has lobbied for legislation last year and again this year. indeed, chairman frank held a hearing in 2008 on this matter. the second basis of the letter is a long-standing dispute between some survivors against the jewish claims conference, based in new york city, which was officially designated in the 1950s by the governments of germany and israel to be the negotiator with the german government on behalf of jewish holocaust survivors. the bulk of the $60 billion paid by the german government since the 1950s in reparations is passed through the claims conference, which then distributes it to survivors. their complaints range from a lack of transparency in their operations to the 80%-20% split, by which 80% of their proceeds go directly to survivors and 20% to various jewish organizations for projects of remembrance and education about the holocaust. my association with the jewish claims conference, which was fully disclosed during my vetting, is very tangential. i volunteered to lead their once a year negotiation with the german government to improve pensions for survivors, to provide new services like home care, and to increased the population of survivors covered by the german government. i have done this once, in march of this year, with, by the way, major breakthroughs for survivors. none of these issues is involved in the prague conference, and the german government has no problem with my participation. that is the only involvement i have with the claims conference. i do not participate in their governing bodies, and have no hand in their allocation or other decisions. i will not be involved again, until their next negotiation, in 2010, unless i decide not to continue my voluntary negotiation for them. moreover, the letter is unbelievably inaccurate. while i have only been involved for several weeks as the official head of the delegation, it is grossly inaccurate for them to allege that survivors have been left out of the process. ambassador kennedy has done remarkable outreach to the survivor community for many months, in preparation for the prague conference, and survivors are well represented on the delegation. in the period since i have been officially involved, i have met with the german insurance association to see if they would make a contribution for the social needs of survivors; have talked with judah gribetz, the special master for the swiss bank settlement, to see if any of the extra sums they will have left over can be given to survivors; have worked to get language in the terezin declaration to encourage countries to set up special funds for survivors and to use heirless property to assist them. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05762459 date: 06/30/2015

liphshiz, with respect to your article yesterday on the utterly unwarranted personal attack on ambassador stuart eizenstat by a group of american holocaust survivors, you should be aware that the leadership of the largest organization of survivors and descendants of survivors in the united states, the american gathering of jewish holocaust survivors and their descendants, in no way shares these sentiments. on the contrary, we hold ambassador eizenstat in the highest esteem, know him to be a man of the highest integrity and ethical standards, and are deeply grateful to him for everything he has done and continues to do on behalf of the survivors over many years. neither david schaecter nor leo rechter speak for anyone other than the groups they represent, and mr. rechter's statement that survivors have \"no confidence\" in ambassador eizenstat is, viewed most charitably, a gross overstatement in that he seeks to attribute his personal prejudices to the many thousands of survivors who do not share his views and who have never authorized him to speak in their name. the lives of thousands upon thousands of survivors throughout the world have been made easier over the past 15 years thanks to ambassador eizenstat's tireless work on their behalf. i cannot think of anyone more appropriate to head the u.s. delegation to the prague conference. the fact is that ambassador eizenstat's only association with the claims conference is a once a year, three day negotiation as a volunteer with the german government for the interests of the survivors. the first such negotiation took place earlier this year in march and resulted in 13,000 survivors who had previously been turned down becoming eligible for for reparations for the first time, and in the improvement in existing pension payments to survivors totaling over $50 million. moreover, the specific pension issues for which he volunteered to negotiate with the german government bear no relationship to the issues being covered by the prague conference. during the clinton administration, ambassador eizenstat was the special representative of the president and secretary of state on holocaust era issues and the lead negotiator on such issues with the swiss, german, austrian and french governments, as well as with various eastern and central european governments. in that capacity, he obtained over $8 billion dollars in compensation and restitution for holocaust survivors, including payments to slave and forced laborers, the return of thousands of jewish communal and private properties, the payments of tens of thousands of previously undisclosed bank accounts, the recovery of hundreds of pieces of looted art, and the payments on thousands of insurance policies. indeed, ambassador eizenstat is more responsible than any other single person for placing the issue of justice for holocaust survivors on the international agenda more than half a century after the end of world war ii. he has also headed the u.s. delegations to every one of the four previous international conferences dealing with holocaust era assets, beginning with the 1997 london conference on nazi gold. messrs. schaecter and rechter are well aware of all this, and the fact that they chose to engage in an ad hominem attack against ambassador eizenstat one week before the opening of the prague conference - his appointment as head of the u.s. delegation was publicly announced weeks ago - is unseemly and disingenuous in the extreme. 34 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no.

more to the point, the final (and therefore top-billed) speaker wasn't conway. it was clinton. the conway people didn't mind. they were glad to have him. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05772705 date: 08/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05772705 date: 08/31/2015 rail-thin but not frail, wearing a tweedy professorial sports coat and his signature rueful, knowing smile, clinton was treated with a respect bordering on awe. his familiar mane of white hair, thinning now, was translucent in the sun, giving him an almost otherworldly look: the sage from a better age. clinton is beloved in kentucky. he won the state twice. he speaks the local dialect, which contains appalachian notes of working-class pride, suspicion of big shots and baptist revivalism. but more than that -- and more than just in kentucky -- clinton's economic record (22.7 million jobs created, and he tends not to forget to mention the .7) looks spectacularly good in the context of what has followed. these days there is almost an old testament, milk-and-honey reverence for that economic record, at least as expressed by former kentucky sen. wendell ford. an old-school podium pounder, ford -- stooped but still strong voiced at 86 -- talked of the former president in messianic terms. \"bill clinton found us the path to gold!\" he shouted. the crowd of 2,000, most of them students, didn't laugh. they seemed to think he was right. how any of this helps obama is far from clear; it isn't even clear that it helps many democrats -- since they'd be joining the same washington party that the current president ostensibly heads. but clinton is all too happy to show obama how it's done. as a campaigner and as president, clinton's gift was his ability to untangle the knots of even the most complex policy issue and explain it in plain language to people suspicious of the powerful -- but eager not to be screwed by them or to be seen as dupes. republicans and their corporate allies were out to shut down the few good things that government does for you, he said, in the name of balancing a budget that they themselves destroyed. \"i gave you budget surpluses!\" clinton said, as if this had been an act of personal beneficence. knowing his audience, the former president focused on pell grants, and on a new program that allows graduates to pay back their loans over longer periods and at lower rates. paul, he said, will try to take that new program away -- and, given the gop's deliberate vagueness about spending cuts -- there is reason to think clinton is right. which is why paul got personal today. which means clinton drew blood. which means that he did what he came to do. which means obama will remain invisible, at least in kentucky, at least for now, and probably for a long time to come. ci unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05772705 date: 08/31/2015  "

(source comment: according to an extremely sensitive source, jalil continues to believe that this chaotic situation should not be surprising. he regularly points out that eight months is not a sufficient amount of time to build functioning institutions from the remnants of the regime of former dictator muammar al qaddafi. the old regime featured a dysfunctional bureaucracy, idiosyncratic rule, and anti-institutionalism. additionally, jalil now realizes that due to pronounced incompetence and a lack of will to take unpopular decisions the el-keib government also failed to make progress in the few areas where it could have achieved meaningful change. the towns of sirte and tawargha are representative of the situation in the countryside where people lost their homes in the conflict and have been living in temporary camps with limited ability to register and vote in their home district. jalil has been urged by contacts in the french and italian governments to guarantee the rights of people across the country. in particular, he has serious concerns as to whether or not supporters of former dictator fv1uammar al qaddafi in his hometown of sirte will be included in the future political processes of the new libya; if they are not allowed to vote by local militiamen. at the same time the fighting between libyan arabs and tebu tribesmen in the kufra area threatens to prevent any voting unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2015-04841 doc no. c05739883 date: 05/13/2015 state dept. - produced to house select benghazi comm. subject to agreement on sensitive information & redactions. no foia waiver. state-scb0045195 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2015-04841 doc no. c05739883 date: 05/13/2015 state dept. - produced to house select benghazi comm. subject to agreement on sensitive information & redactions. no foia waiver. there. jalil has been warned that the ntc regulations now state that members of the national army are not allowed to vote or run for office, which is a disincentive for armed militia brigade members to become legitimate soldiers.) 5.this well informed individual believes that despite these flaws, the new government created by the july 7 election will eventually have the mandate to take the difficult decisions that can create a reconciliation process. jalil will work to maintain order in this transition period, and finally reach his goal of creating a situation where the government can rebuild homes and restore sufficient law and order; allowing those in sirte, tawargha, kufra, and throughout the rest of the country to live in their hometowns, establishing a situation where a true civil society can develop. 6. jalil, in conversations with the leaders of the muslim brotherhood (mb), and separately with liberal leader all tarhouni, has acknowledged that the central government's top priority must be security and that the ntc has been unable to provide it. that said, jalil and minister of defense ousarna al-juwali have pledged to provide 30,000 to 40,000 security personnel for election day to 'prevent similar incidents to the july 1 attack on benghazi's election headquarters. in that case eastern federalists entered the building, where ballot papers were burned and ballot boxes destroyed. similarly, these federalist forces are suspected of the attack on july 5 that burned down ajdabiyals main storage centre for election materials. 7. in the opinion of this individual, although those responsible for the benghazi attack were pro-federalist, it has not been proven that they were members of the self-appointed cyrenaican national council (cnc), whose military arm set up a roadblock in wadi al-ahmar on libya's major east-west highway to demand that cyrenaica get as many seats in the gnc as tripolitania. thus far, neither the cnc nor any other group has publicly stated that they intend to use violence to disrupt the elections.

frederick jones, communications director, 202-224-4651 kerry, lugar amendment to restore full funding to president obama's international affairs budget washington, dc  senate foreign relations committee chairman john kerry, on the senate floor today introduced an amendment to restore four billion dollars in cuts to the president's international affairs budget. the senator's full remarks as prepared are below: if the first years of the twenty-first century have taught us anything about national security, it is that in a globalized world, our problems are interconnected, and soultimatelyis our security. we are endangered by weak and failed states as well as by strong states. we are endangered by diseases and climate change emissions half a world away. we are endangered when we allow chaos and crisis to create the conditions for ideologies of radical hatred and violence to take root. and it is clear to all that meeting these global challenges will require far more than our military: it will require a strengthened commitment to diplomacy and development. to put this as simply and bluntly as possible, that's why passing a robust foreign affairs budget is a matter not just of america's world leadership, but also of our national security. but don't take my word for it: ask our secretary of defense, bob gates. he said: \"what is clear to me is that there is a need for a dramatic increase in spending on the civilian instruments of national security  diplomacy, strategic communications, foreign assistance, civic action, and economic reconstruction and development.\" ask our secretary of state and former colleague, hillary clinton, who testified in her confirmation hearing that \"the relatively small but important amount of money we do spend on foreign aid is in the best interests of the american people\" and \"promotes our national security and advances our interests and reflects our values.\" when our soldiers and generals join our top diplomats in demanding increased civilian capacity and increased civilian fundingeven in the midst of an economic crisis that's when you know there is not just a growing consensus, but a real sense of urgency behind strengthening our civilian mission. returning diplomacy and development to their rightful place cannot be achieved through words alone: it takes money to drive civilian foreign policyand if it keeps us safer, as i believe it will, then that is money well spent. full funding of the president's international affairs budget is a vital step toward greater civilian capacity, and i urge my colleagues to support it. that's why, along with senators lugar, leahy, voinovich, durbin, kaufman, menendez, dodd, feinstein, brown, sanders, lieberman, casey, and corker, i ask for approval of this amendment to restore $4 billion worth of funding to the president's fy 2010 international affairs budget request for the function 150 account. the offset here will come from the function 920 account. the reality is that right now, we are not doing nearly enough to invest in diplomacy and development. that's the finding of numerous studies conducted inside and outside of government. funding for the department of defense is over half a trillion dollars. in 2008, the army added about 7,000 soldiers to its total; that's more people than serve in the entire american foreign service. 1,100 foreign service officers could be hired for the cost of a single c-17 military cargo plane. and four billion dollars is less than two percent of what the government has given to aig. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f!2014-20439 doc no. c05760665 date: 06/30/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05760665 date: 06/30/2015 that is vital context for any discussion of the president's proposed increase in the international affairs budget. the president requested $53.8 billion in fy 2010 to fund next year's budgetan increase of 8%, or $4 billion, over last year's funding level of $49.8 billion. we must recognize just what a small share of our overall spending the president's international affairs budget comprises: 1.4% of the total fy 2010 budget and only 6.8% of the \"national security budget,\" which includes defense and homeland security. even with this year's proposed increase in funding, the international affairs budget still represents just 0.35% of gdp. this sliver of our budget funds all state department operations, foreign aid and foreign policy programs, our diplomatic programs, global health initiatives on hiv/aids, malaria and tuberculosis programs, and humanitarian assistance to help stabilize fragile states, reduce global poverty and assist refugees. some have described the president's request as a 41% increase from last year's budget of $38 billion, but that simply isn't accurate: the figure of $38 billion doesn't include last year's supplemental appropriations, which raise the total to nearly $50 billion. the president's fy 2010 budget includes supplemental appropriations. that's why the actual increase is only $4 billion, or 8%. when we talk about changes in spending, we have to compare apples to apples. what's more, the president should be commended for following through on his pledge to enhance transparency and improve fiscal discipline by shifting supplemental appropriations into a single budget. this is a more straightforward way of doing business that doesn't seek to hide or massage spending figures by tucking extra spending into supplemental bills. that is why my colleague senator conrad, the chairman of the budget committee, has been vocal in praising this new approach. but the real question we are facing today is what will this extra $4 billion get us? this $4 billion will bring vital foreign aid increases to programs in pakistan and afghanistan. this $4 billion will build civilian capacity and put our diplomats back on the front lines of american foreign policy. this $4 billion will provide life saving treatment for people with hiv/aids and supports broad prevention efforts that save lives every day. this $4 billion will help make people all over the world safer, and in the process, it will help keep america safer. of course, some will claim that in the midst of a global economic crisis, we do not have the luxury of leading on the global stage. but this is precisely the moment when our investment is most neededand it is also a moment when our leadership and our economic system face the greatest challenge. and ultimately, efforts in the developing world win us influence and respect, and they also contribute to the growth and stability of future consumers of our products and future trading partners. there is scarcely a corner of the globe where our efforts are not impacted by this budget: in afghanistan and pakistan, we must finally reverse years of neglect and drift. imagine a nation as populous as iraq, afghanistan and north koreacombined. a nation with a full arsenal of nuclear weapons, and ballistic missiles capable of delivering them anywhere in a thousand- kilometer range. imagine a nation whose population is overwhelmingly moderate, overwhelmingly committed to democracy and rule of lawbut deeply suspicious of its leadership, and of america's friendship. imagine a nation in which osama bin laden and the leadership of al qaeda has found sanctuary for the past seven yearsa haven from which they and their confederates have plotted and carried out attacks on their host country, on neighboring countries, and on sites around the globe. this nation could serve the keystone for a new, cooperative relationship between the western and muslim worldsor become an epicenter for radicalism and violence on a cataclysmic scale. now imagine that 17 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05760665 date: 06/30/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05760665 date: 06/30/2015 america took a long, hard look at the status quo of our policy towards a nation at just such a crossroadsand decided to do nothing different.  we need a bold, new strategy for pakistan: our current path has not brought success, and simply tinkering around the margins is guaranteed to fail. we have little choice but to think big. that is why president obama called on congress to pass the enhanced partnership with pakistan act that sen. lugar and i will introduce very soon: it will authorize $1.5 billion annually, in order to help shape a new relationship with pakistan. without the full authorization of the president's budget, even a priority as vital as this one could be shunted aside. we are not the only ones vying for influence. you know who else understands clearly how powerful a weapon foreign aid can be? iran does. that's why after its proxy hezbollah provoked israel's bombing of lebanon, they painted the green hezbollah flag on houses all over lebanonhouses they plan to rebuild, largely with iranian money. if we don't spend money on aid, we are surrendering the field to those who do. nor can we afford to abandon our efforts against global aids. we know that pepfar has won america friends and allies across africa and the world we know that aids contributes to failed states, not to mention incalculable human misery amongst the sick and dying and the orphans they leave behindand that is why our national interest and our moral interest demand that we deliver on our commitments at a moment of crisis. last year, both parties came together to authorize up to $48 billion over five years. today, it is imperative that we do all we can to fund these programs. if we don't, we will freeze enrollment of patients into life-saving antiretroviral treatment. meanwhile, prevention efforts the most cost-effective way to stop aids from ravaging a societywill be the first ones cut. and tragically, we know what will happen next: more people will contract hiv, and more will die from aids-related illnesses. refugees and human rights advocates also need our help. economic support funds are vital to support those living inside countries with repressive regimes, like burma and zimbabwe. we know that refugees and displaced populations can be the spark for large-scale violence, and today we face that very threat from the millions displaced from homes in iraq. our migration and refugee assistance is more important than ever to help us provide immediate, effective assistance to these vulnerable populations. our international affairs budget will also have profound implications for another national security issue that will only grow in importance: the threat of global climate change. this december, the global community will be meeting in copenhagen to create a new international agreement to address the urgent threat of global climate change. the science is screaming at us: we have no time to lose if we hope to avert catastrophe. if we want to persuade the developing nations of the world to do what is necessary and in all of our interests we must help them to respond now to the impacts of the crisis that are already being felt globallyand to preemptively make the dramatic technological changes across their economies that this threat demands. our leverage at the negotiating table in copenhagen will depend directly on our ability to offer a strong financing package. negotiators are meeting for an interim session this week in bonn, and it is essential that we send a clear signal that the united states congress is serious about financing to support the commitments the obama administration makes on the world stageand serious about being part of the global solution to one of the greatest threats we face. we also need more diplomats and aid officers to troubleshoot on the front lines. the 2010 budget also marks the first year of a new commitment to a significant increase in the size of the foreign service at both the state department and usaid. today we are barely covering attrition rates. we have asked these agencies to expand their missions and operations into new theaters like iraq and afghanistanand we need to expand their resources accordingly. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05760665 date: 06/30/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05760665 date: 06/30/2015 even as we face long-term security threats such as climate change, we must also address the immediate and urgent threats of nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism. the president's budget provides additional nonproliferation and counter-proliferation funding to secure nuclear materials around the world, and to fund new and ongoing initiatives to build the counterterrorism capacity of partnering countries to do the same. that's how you leverage our civilian spending to keep america safe. surveying the wide range of commitments and aspirations this budget addresses, it is clear that our challenge is immense. and yet, even as we confront a crisis here at home, we cannot afford to delay the task of restoring our leadership, returning to our best traditions of civilian outreach, and restoring our influence and authority. we cannot afford to come up short on our promises to allies, to vulnerable populations, and to the world. we cannot try to be a world leader on the cheap. if we fail to do our part to solve the world's problems, those problems will eventually find us here at home. from pandemics to climate change to failed states, this century's security challenges demand that a new level of commitment to diplomacy and development. with this relatively small investment, we are making significant strides toward restoring america's leadership role in the world. it will make the world safer, and it will make us safer. and so i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the president's budget request.

as a former american ambassador who has lived and worked the better part of four decades around germany, my blackberry often glows red hot with messages from persons asking these questions. my response is always the same: germany has changed very little, but europe and the world have changed a lot. therein lies the dilemma. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05768699 date: 08/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05768699 date: 08/31/2015 germany has worked hard to dig its way out of the disaster of 1945, but trauma remains a defining issue for german society. sixty five years later, germany is still focused on the three essentials of its recovery: stability, respectability and peace. keep this triangle in mind and lots of things quickly come into focus. from the first days of the federal republic, germany's leaders emphasized the importance of defining interests solely within a common european and atlantic vocation. but they also understood that renouncing national ambitions did not remove the responsibility to pursue specific german goals through the common institutions. many important postwar accomplishments were conceived and pushed by germany, sometimes over the opposition of others  including the united states. ostpolitik was controversial for years, as was nato enlargement. germany pushed them with determination. helmut kohl did not consult before promulgating his 10 points on reunification. he agreed to french desires for a common currency, but only if it could be a mirror of the deutsche mark, for decades the european monetary standard. the euro stability pact, now the object of so much controversy with greece, was the result. after 1990, the e.u.'s eastward expansion was germany's way of firming up its eastern flank. slowly and without fanfare, germany has been remaking the european union in its image. at each step of the way, germany made its wishes more palatable by paying more than its share. part of today's misunderstanding is caused by germany's success in using its contributions to build an image of selflessness. germany has been as single-minded in pursuit of its goals as charles de gaulle ever was for his, but it almost always left leadership to others. a new consciousness grew after the costs of reunification began to mount. \"europe\" in the institutional sense has become increasingly unpopular. german courts have begun to define german european issues in the context of the german constitution rather than on the basis of e.u. law. at least some of ms. merkel's refusal to allow immediate assistance to greece was based on her fears that it would fan anti-e.u. sentiment at home. are these the first signs of a german tea party? here we find the source of most of the hand wringing about germany's role as the \"motor of europe.\" ms. merkel's unwillingness to sweeten the financial pot echoed throughout brussels. to many, it signified the decline of german willingness to \"salute the french flag three times before raising the german flag,\" as konrad adenauer used to put it. germans are not alone in objecting to throwing more money into the e.u. pot, but they happen to be the only ones who can do something about it. many fear that without german complaisance, the e.u. will stutter to a stop. but such self- denial could never offer a viable foundation for a new europe. neither could the inefficiency and even corruption that characterizes many e.u. programs. most maddening for most thinking europeans is the knowledge that the germans are right. but to them, the question is whether germany is remaking the e.u. in a fashion palatable to the majority of other member states. they are not so sure that its focus on stability and accountability is the right way to help such a diverse collection of peoples adjust to a globalized world. and so when angela merkel raps greek knuckles, she is sending a message most europeans don't want to hear. not that germany is dangerous; even worse, that it is unrelenting. the neue ziiricher zeitung probably spoke for many others when it once accused germany of wanting europe to become a large switzerland. the growing gap between germany's aspirations and the perceived needs of other members of the e.u. is beginning to burden both sides. most europeans are simply not ready to live up to german standards. without a more flexible sense of common purpose, the project to build a democratic europe could stop dead in the water. but as germans will themselves often tell you: they have forgotten how to dream. younger germans feel this lack of inspiration as well. dreams were what 200,000 of them were waiting to hear when they rallied to hear barack obama in berlin two summers ago. they wanted more than to \"dare to hope,\" which is the characteristically timid german translation of the title of the president's best seller. and they are still waiting. america seems busy elsewhere. the main conclusion i draw from the debate about germany is that it is not about germany at all. the task of building a democratic europe is far from complete. most of the foundations have been laid and now the residents are starting to haggle over the design. weaving today's 27 states into a true trans-atlantic partnership is a task that is too big for germany or even europe to accomplish alone. they desperately need some skilled architectural assistance. uniting europe and north america is the most audacious project ever conceived. if it works, the united states will be joined by nearly 500 million europeans to form a democratic space, within which modern democratic values will harness more energy than in any single nation on earth. democracy's future as the operating system for a globalized world will be assured. unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05768699 date: 08/31/2015 unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05768699 date: 08/31/2015 european fecklessness seems to worry washington officials these days. but if germany has forgotten how to dream and the united states is too busy to try, we will both be guilty of perpetuating the aimlessness we so criticize. to hold up its side of the bargain, europe needs exactly what barack obama originally promised  the audacity of hope. john kornblum, senior counselor with the international law firm noerr llp in berlin, served as the u.s. ambassador to germany from 1997 to 2001. <http://up.nytimes.com/?d=0/9/&t=&s=l&ui=1384214&r=http%3a%2p/o2fwww%2enytimes%2ecom%2f2010%2f04%2f 23%2fopinion%2f23iht%2dedkornblum%2ehtml%3femc%3deta1&u=www%2enytimes%2ecom%2f2010%2f04%2f23%2f opinion%2f23iht%2dedkornblum%2ehtml%3femc%3deta1%26pagewanted%3dprint> dcsimg <http://wt.o.nytimes.com/dcsym57yw10000s1s8goboozt_9tlx/njs.gif?dcsuri=hojavascript&wt.js=no&wt.tv=1.0.7> <http://www.nytimes.com/adx/bin/clientside/2c7bce8402frbl051tt4q23tlwq5105105bq25tq2at02202202abq2 3q.22051> unclassified u.s. department of state case no. f-2014-20439 doc no. c05768699 date: 08/31/2015  "
